This mod is protected under Cam's Licensing Agreement, a special, divinely enforced meme license with unique open-source properties, described below.

	Feel free to take these files, scoop out its innards, and make your own mod out of the husk. Mutate and abuse this mod to your liking, fix every error you see, and reupload it as your own. All I ask is that in the mod description, you put "Thanks Cam" somewhere. You really don't even have to give any context or credit me in any greater extent as long as you don't claim you made anything you didn't or put the "Thanks Cam" in a misleading context. Either you remain vague and write "Thanks Cam" with no context, or you contextualize it honestly. Beyond this stipulation, you need ask no permission and can do as you please with this mod.

Telling me about your mod will grant you 15 brownie points, which you can cash in at your nearest white knight bank location.

Failure to comply will result in your termination within 150 years, and could cause manboy tears.

Thanks for your time. Keep it spicy.
