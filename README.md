# Christianity Besieged

Christianity besieged is an alternative history mod set in a world in which Christianity was not adopted by the roman empire and continued to exist only as diasporic communities.

As the Roman Empire lost control over the Levant and Anatolia, the Sassanid Empire was free to reign in the expansion of the Islamic Caliphates and through it's conflict expanded to the edges of India.

Continuing to weather conflicts with the Roman Empire, the Germanic religious customs and traditions syncretise with Hunnic Gothic traditions forming a more centralised religion and creating the great empire of the Germanians

When the Roman Empire finally fell to the Turks most of the shattered remnants embrace Islam.
