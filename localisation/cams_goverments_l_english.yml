 pontic_empire_reform:0 "Basileia tou Pontou"
 pontic_empire_reform_desc:0 "The Pontic Empire is the ancient imperial government that slowly gained hegemony of Anatolia between 281 to 62 BC, securing its place against the expanding Romans and surviving a devastating series of civil wars in Armenia and Anatolia that left the region mostly under the influence of the Iranians, which would culminate in the rise of the Sasanian dynasty from Pars.\n While the Parthian Empire mostly exerted its influence in Armenia and the Pontus through diplomatic strongman tactics and the shared dynastic heritage between Armenia and Iran, the Sasanians would rule over Armenia outright, leaving its dynasty as a vassal and subsequently picking away at the Pontic Empire's power. Cappadocia and Cilicia became subject to the Sasanians, and would greatly grow in power as the Sasanians used their subjects to administer conquered Pontic land, though civil wars such as the Roman-backed Phrygian uprising in the 4th century AD would be put down. But as Christianity spread throughout southern Anatolia, and the Vandals invaded the European Hellenes and established a Christian Vandal Kingdom, which would dominate the politics of Eastern Anatolia and the Aegean until its conversion to Islam in the 9th century, which would not be followed by most Hellenes who became heavily suppressed during the Vandal Caliphate era.\n But the damage was done, the Pontic Empire's control over its eastern vassals had been sundered. Its inability to destroy the Isaurians after four different failed attacks left the Pamphylii, Lykiaes, Carians, and Phrygians little defense against Isaruaian raiding, but great resentment towards the throne at Sinope. The Phrygian city states of Dorylaion and Laodikeia would form a dual monarchy that would rule from Gordion, encouraged by the Vandals, Iranians, and Hellenic Christians.\n Despite the loss of tribute and support from its vassals, great amounts of breathing room would be created by the downfall of the supermassive Sasanian Empire to the hands of the Mongols, who would form an Ilkhanate that never threatened anything beyond Iran proper. But by then, Armenia and the empowered Cappadocians on their own were stronger than Pontus. Legitimacy for the Empire truly entered freefall upon the creation of the rump state of Pahphlagonia, which rules the ancient capital yet recognizes Cappadocia as the overlord of the Anatolians. If we are to survive and re-establish legitimacy, we must reconquer the capital and reestablish suzerainty."
