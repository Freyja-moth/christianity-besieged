 sebkhEvents.t:0 "Spah Burzafrah's Unstoppable Will"
 sebkhEvents.d:0 "There is something about Spah Burzafrah, an aura about him. Fascinating and engaging in conversation, an incredible storyteller with boundless lessons from a long journey across the world... his charisma is unmatched by his peers, and he knows nothing but glory and victory. Whatever plans the Gods have from him, they are greatly in his favor. Being under his just rule is to be part of a glorious, heavenly project in creation on Earth, and his boundless energy has infected the nation. Some believe he will never die, that he is simply a projection of divine will - frusterated at the failures of Man to remove the darkness of the world and free humanity from the material plane."
 sebkhEvents.a:0 "We are blessed to have him."
 sebkhEvents.1t:0 "The Tragedy of Burzafrah's Demise"
 sebkhEvents.1d:0 "At the greatest of costs, it seems that Burzafrah has finally taken the ultimate journey, fully cleansing and liberating the lightness of his soul and returning to the heavens, leaving behind the darkness of his ashes. Though the deep corruption of light and darkness has been filtered from the Earth slightly more, and we are greatful for this, what does it mean for the heavenly project of the Sebkhemerz that was promised? What does it mean for our future if Spah Burzafrah truly was not a divine projection of the light?"
 sebkhEvents.1a:0 "He achieved his destiny... but at what cost?"
 sebkhEvents.2t:0 "The Emptying of Iliropolis"
 sebkhEvents.2d:0 "The besieging and seizing of Iliropolis was a tumultuous affair, one that has sparked great controversy amongst the European Muslims, who treated the Illiri city as an important religious center. One would think our seizure would prove Mani's claims, but our show of religious righteousness has been violently spurned. The Iliri leave in massive droves, crossing the Adriatic by any means possible, leaving the small but rapidly growing Caracalpac minority that have followed our conquest. Their numbers are not nearly enough to maintain Iliropolis, leaving it in great danger of falling into disrepair. However, it also provides us with a great amount of real estate, and we could exploit this rather than saving this single city."
 sebkhEvents.2a:0 "It'll grow back in time."
 sebkhEvents.2b:0 "Seize the most valuable land to give as later rewards to retired nobles and generals."
 sebkhEvents.2c:0 "Provide incentives to quickly resettle the city to its former glory."
 sebkhEvents.3t:0 "Maintaining the Safety of the Faithful"
 sebkhEvents.3d:0 "With our growing influence in the region, we now stand increasingly responsible for the safety of our westerly neighbors. It only makes sense for us to provide them their defense, so long as they follow Sebkhemerz law and act accordingly to Mani and Burzafrah's visions."
 sebkhEvents.3a:0 "Fear not, you have our protection."
 sebkhEvents.4t:0 "The Assembly at Ortet"
 sebkhEvents.4d:0 "The Assembly at Ortet would bring the Iranian-speaking aristocracy together,  mostly being the mercenaries who had followed Burzafrah into Southeastern Europe, in order to standardize and create a stable means of governing the state. With the power to enrich or disempower the strong military aristocracy that had brought the Sebkhemerz to where it stands today, what direction will [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] take for the Sebkhemerz Order?"
 sebkhEvents.4a:0 "The Sebkhemerz followers ARE the state."
 sebkhEvents.4b:0 "Transform the followers into a landed feudal nobility."
 sebkhEvents.4c:0 "The followers can stay in the military, but the clergy will have the real power."
 sebkhEvents.5t:0 "Visions of a Nation"
 sebkhEvents.5d:0 "The Sebkhemerz Order has come a long way in cementing itself as one of the strongest European powers. No longer do our rivals view us as a raging fire, doomed to burn ourselves out, but rather as a nation, a people fueled by the eternal war between darkness and light. We have created for ourselves a grand new nation, and this land has become the land of Mani. No longer are we a band of righteous with a grand vision for a land of light, we have reached this goal!"
 sebkhEvents.5a:0 "Manideh, land of light and order!"
 sebkhEvents.5b:0 "Manideh, the Illuminated Empire!"
 sebkhEvents.5c:0 "Manideh, the Eternal Fire of the West!"
