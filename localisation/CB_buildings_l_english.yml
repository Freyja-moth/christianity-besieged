 building_cultus_domus_desc:0 "Fidemarxes are Middle Roman constructions that were built in regions of the Empire prone to migratory groups, as they could serve as legitimizing bastions of Roman authority. Their initial designs are thanks to the expertise of the Therevingi-Roman engineer known as Sisefonsus, who created the first rudimentary Fidemarx in the 5th century. Over the course of the new few centuries, the Fidemarx system would overtake the limes system as their effectiveness began to waver at defending key inner regions of the Empire."
