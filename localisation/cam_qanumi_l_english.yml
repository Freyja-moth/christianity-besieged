 hado_school:0 "Hado!"
 hado_school_desc:0 "The Hado! school was originally a more peaceful reactionary movement to the war-like philosophy of the Kx'ai'as, encouraging peace and development of the homeland they had reconquered already, while building relationships and friendships to spread the faith and protect their new territories. Hado! philosophy dominates the smaller, tribal theocraies scattered across the Q'a Num world, places that either overthrew the Kx'ais that first ruled them or had been peacefully converted by other Hado!s."
 kurudi_school:0 "Kurudi"
 kurudi_school_desc:0 "The Kurudi school is a more orthodox expression of Q'a Num, stressing the importance of conquest to rid the world of Kaggen's lies. The philosophy existed as early as the death of the Q'a Num prophet Saa Dzahi, driving the motivation of every Kx'ai and the Kurudic missions. No true Kurudic proselyte would ever be caught without a copy of the Kurudi itself, which was Saa Dzahi's first written scripture of the faith, presented to the Islamic elite of Mjimbali in 969."

 HOLY_SITE_385_DESC:0 "The city of Mecca was visited by Saa Dzahi in his youth in the 10th century, and he recalls in many of his later texts of how it was the center of all of Kaggen's darkest machinations. An uncountable number of people would travel to give Kaggen tribute, providing him with untold amounts of strength. To be able to stem the flow of this tribute would be a great boon to the Earth."
 HOLY_SITE_4978_DESC:0 "The city of Mjimbali is a very important city to the Q'a Num, being the birthplace of the founding prophet of the faith, Saa Dzahi. Despite this, Mjimbali was founded by and has been for the majority of its history an Islamic city, and Saa Dzahi's first attempt to convert the city and make it his capital in 970 lead to his first of two exoduses. It is grouped together with Qhaanue and Tsumeb as part of the ||Ae, or Three, the most important centers of the faith, and is known in formal religious texts as |'Ua||ae. For all these reasons, controlling Mjimbali has always been an extremely important priority for the Q'a Num."
 HOLY_SITE_4988_DESC:0 "The city of Qhaanue is important to the Q'a Num for being the resting place and first settlement founded by Saa Dzahi after his exodus from Mjimbali, up the |Nu!arib River to the founding site of the city. The first Qhaanue would become the rapidly developed center of the infant Q'a Num faith from 970-980, at the end of which an Islamic coalition would arrive to drive Saa Dzahi and the Q'a Num faithful from the region, causing his second exodus, the mythical crossing of the Namib. Qhannue would later be resettled by one of the Kurudiju!ha bands arriving from the Namib, who would seize the city for themselves against the Xuukhoe Sikhum|gui. As a part of the ||Ae, Qhaanue is sometimes known in formal religious texts as |Num||ae."
 HOLY_SITE_1306_DESC:0 "The city of Muthalia is an infamous but nevertheless important city to the Q'a Num. Being a center of gravity of Islam growing in the region concurrently with the spread of the true faith in the region, religious scholars generally agreed that this new religious sect was specifically created by Kaggen in reaction to his plans being actualized. The Muthalians and their Mudarian faith is propped up on the routine raiding and extraction of Q'a Num and other pagan faithful, a strategy employed in order to weaken our grasp on the region. For these reasons, the destruction of the Mudarian campaign is very important to the maintenance of the Q'a Num."
 HOLY_SITE_5007_DESC:0 "The city of Tsumeb is important to the Q'a Num faith for being the final capital of the Saadzahi Kx'ai, the first Q'a Num kingdom founded by the prophet Saa Dzahi. While not created by him, it was built up upon the arrival of the Kx'ai, who had been lead across the Namib by Saa Dzahi after he cooled the deserts, wrought oasies out of the sands, and brought unprecended numbers of wild game in the dunes for them to sustain their great numbers. Tsumeb would become the most important center of learning of the faith as Saa Dzahi built multiple centers of learning to enlighten his vast tribal population and those that they spread the faith to. During the reign of Kx'ai'aa Un!om of the brief Un!omi Kx'ai, which immediately succeeded Saa Dzahi's death, the proto-Kunaa script began to be used in official religious script in Tsumeb and in Un!om's letters, inspired by Saa Dzahi's wishes for an alphabet for the disparate groups of languages spoken by the faithful. As the last of the three ||Ae, Tsumeb is sometimes called ||Ae|ae, or ||Aeg|kx'abu, or the Root ||Ae, as Saa Dzahi laid the faith's roots in the city."
