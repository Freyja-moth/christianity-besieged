 estate_gangans_ikenga_privileges_desc:0 "While the eze Nri lives beyond the view of the public, he employs officials called ndi Nri. These ritual specialists travel with ritual staffs of peace to purify the earth from human crimes, exercising authority over the Igbo and choosing successors. The Odinani Nri is open to Ndi Nri traveling within them to perform rituals and ensure bountiful harvest or restore harmony in local affairs. Local men within the odinani Nri can represent the eze Nri and share his moral authority by purchasing a series of ranked titles called Ozo and Nze. Men with these titles, the mbùríchi, are an extension of the Nri's religio-political system. They control the means for agriculture and determine guilt or innocence in disputes. Both the Ndi Nri priests and mbùríchi nobility belonged to the Ikénga, the right hand, the organ through which the God Ìkénga grants us our ability to achieve and our power."
