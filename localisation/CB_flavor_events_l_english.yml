 CBFlavorEvents.1t:0 "Twilight of Rome"
 CBFlavorEvents.1d:0 "In 1334, 110 years ago, the Turks crossed the Adriatic and have occupied Rome ever since, playing the sweet serenade of Islam to subdue their new subjects. The Twilight of Rome casts an enormous shadow over the future of all of Europa, and it is our duty to remind the Romans of their true suzerains."
 CBFlavorEvents.1a:0 "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is the 2nd Rome."
 CBFlavorEvents.2t:0 "Apathy of Dhorhammer"
 CBFlavorEvents.2d:0 "The Nordic band of veterans concentrated at the fortress of Dhorhammer generally only cared about two things - the production of grapes and grain for alcohol, and the payment of tribute. This created an environment for the dominant Jewish population to be able to specialize in other trades with near total autonomy, evading the eyes of the Dhorhammer nobility and the larger Magyar entity they gave tribute to."
 CBFlavorEvents.2a:0 "So long as we're paid."
 CBFlavorEvents.3t:0 "The Nepopteia of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 CBFlavorEvents.3d:0 "Very early in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s life, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] went through Telete and Epopteia, two layers of initiation into the Orphic rites in order to achieve salvation from the Titanic, purify and relive the suffering and death of Zagreus. But to rule over a land bound by the sacred oath of Dionysus, a ruler must go through the third layer, and participate in a Nepopteia. Only the grandest of sacrifices and the sharpest of agonies, to truly mark a new era. What kind of message does [Root.Monarch.GetName] have for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people at the ceremony?"
 CBFlavorEvents.3a:0 "The Old [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] spins on the Wheel of Rebirth."
 CBFlavorEvents.3b:0 "We will hone our Titanic prisons to destroy our enemies."
 CBFlavorEvents.3c:0 "We must do what we can to purify ourselves."
 CBFlavorEvents.3e:0 "We shall seek intoxication of enthusiasm!"

However, we don't necessary need them to settle there. What should we do?"
 CBFlavorEvents.4a:0 "Accept them with gratitude."
 CBFlavorEvents.4b:0 "Distribute the [Root.event_target:caliphial_culture.Culture.GetName] amongt the colonies."
 CBFlavorEvents.4c:0 "We don't need [Root.event_target:caliphial_culture.Culture.GetName] in [Root.event_target:caliphial_province.GetName]!"
 CBFlavorEvents.7t:0 "A Preacher in [Root.GetName]"
 CBFlavorEvents.7da:0 "A local Hellenic preacher has been gaining quite some prominence within the community of [Root.GetCapitalName], teaching others about some of the fringe deities of the greater Hellenic pantheon. If left unopposed, the community seems certain to eventually change their religious views."
 CBFlavorEvents.7db:0 "A local Orphic preacher has been gaining quite some prominence within the community of [Root.GetCapitalName], something we discovered when city officials informed us of their discovery of large-scale initiation rites. His great sum of wealth and charismatic nature have allowed him to front the payments for and provide the community for these operations. If left unopposed, the community seems certain to eventually change their religious views."
 CBFlavorEvents.7dd:0 "A local Cybele preacher has been gaining quite some prominence within the community of [Root.GetCapitalName], making grand claims about Cybele being the original creation of the Titans, and the true protector of Anatolia. If left unopposed, the community seems certain to eventually change their religious views."
 CBFlavorEvents.7dc:0 "A local Neopythagorean preacher has been gaining quite some prominence within the community of [Root.GetCapitalName], stumping theologians and intellectuals left and right with a wealth of knowledge about the old philosophers. If left unopposed, the community seems certain to eventually change their religious views."
 CBFlavorEvents.7de:0 "A local Orthodox preacher has been gaining quite some prominence within the community of [Root.GetCapitalName], energizing the local population into a frenzy about the dangers of leaving behind the true pantheon of all Hellenic peoples, chastizing those who don't heed the cautionary tales of those who disgraced Zeus in the past. If left unopposed, the community seems certain to eventually change their religious views."
 CBFlavorEvents.7a:0 "Accept the preacher's influence."
 CBFlavorEvents.7b:0 "End the preacher's teachings."
 CBFlavorEvents.7b_tt:0 "Confront the preacher directly and seize his estates, if all goes well he should go quietly."
 CBFlavorEvents.8t:0 "Preacher Rediscovered!"
 CBFlavorEvents.8d:0 "The preacher somehow had managed to elude our first attempted capture, escaping to [Root.GetCapitalName] and establishing a new network of converts and connections before we could discover his whereabouts. How should we approach this situation?"
 CBFlavorEvents.8a:0 "Now he'll face retribution."

 CBFlavorEvents.9t:0 "Triumph of Cybele"
 CBFlavorEvents.9d:0 "At the temple in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], we bear tribute to the Mountain Mother of Anatolia, giving praise to her for our recent conquests.

 CBFlavorEvents.12t:0 "Union of States, or Divided and Conquered?"
 CBFlavorEvents.12d:0 "The proud representative city-states of the Znovuzaty represent a shining bastion of the legacy of the Roman Empire. Our people can profess their heritage from the Roman Dacia era, having settled the region in droves and intermingling with the local population, assimilating them into the prestiguous empire. Unfortunately, it wasn't fated to last, and whatever barbaric force could control the Carpathian Basin would have massive sway over our affairs. For centuries, this has been Great Morava, a state influenced and graced by but not borne from Rome. Though underneath the Moravans we have seen relative stability, we have remained disjointed from Italia for centuries. Are we truly united in this union of city-states? Or are the Moravans keeping us at bay, fearful of the power of an insurgent, independent Roman state?"
 CBFlavorEvents.12a:0 "We are regardless stuck in this status quo."
 CBFlavorEvents.13d:0 "In 1334, 110 years ago, the Turks crossed the Adriatic and have occupied Rome ever since, playing the sweet serenade of Islam to subdue their new subjects. The Twilight of Rome casts an enormous shadow over the future of all of Europa, and it is our duty to remind the Romans of their true suzerains. Let us find a model Roman from the glory days of old to aid us in our plight."

 CBFlavorEvents.13b:0 "Marcus Tullius Cicero did everything in his power to uphold the optimate principles."
 CBFlavorEvents.13c:0 "Marcus Licinuius Crassus had vision for Rome, and wit to amass the wealth to execute it."
 CBFlavorEvents.14t:0 "Ashes of the Middle Kingdom"
 CBFlavorEvents.14d:0 "The Middle Kingdom has experienced centuries of devastation and destruction. No figure has proven worthy enough to wrest the ancient, decayed Yuan horde from their bastion in Dadu, free to raid the weak but making no attempt to govern the realm. Foreign kings land on our shores with little resistance and the splintering of the faith across the Middle Kingdom threatens to split us apart further, perhaps irrevocably."
 CBFlavorEvents.14a:0 "We must put an end to this era of shame!"
 CBFlavorEvents.15t:0 "The Frisian Invasion"
 CBFlavorEvents.15d:0 "It seems that a large company of Frisians, lead by a petty band of disgruntled nobles from the mainland, have taken advantage of the instability of our court and have launched an invasion of the mainland. What should we do?"
 CBFlavorEvents.15a:0 "Defend our home!"
 CBFlavorEvents.15b:0 "Let us focus on protecting the refugees."
 CBFlavorEvents.15c:0 "We must end this bloodshed and make peace."
 CBFlavorEvents.16t:0 "Writing Conventions in Galagne"
 CBFlavorEvents.16d:0 "The early rulers of Galagne, or little Gaul, wore their German-ordained Donreritter familial name proudly, though with a breakdown of writing standardization subsequent rulers wrote their familial titles phonetically. Over time, this heavily warped their name to make it seem almost unrelated to anything Germanic at all, but had a deep influence on the speech patterns of Gallic speakers under their control."
 CBFlavorEvents.16a:0 "My son just trills the family name..."
 CBFlavorEvents.16b:0 "Why won't he just write the damned e?"
 CBFlavorEvents.16c:0 "It's a D, not a T!"
 CBFlavorEvents.16e:0 "Why does my eccentric heir trill our ENTIRE name??"
 CBFlavorEvents.16f:0 "Why does my heir have such a problem with our eloquent title?"
 CBFlavorEvents.16g:0 "I simplified our name for stability. Why make it bland..?"

 desc_tuthegacian_royal_dialect:0 "The bizzare linguistic fads of the higher nobility have caused this generation of nobles to become increasingly detached from the commonfolk they preside over."
