 RomanoBritishEvents.1t:0 "Surge of Refugees"
 RomanoBritishEvents.1d:0 "The situation for the faithful on the mainland of Europe has become a complete disaster. In the wake of crushing defeats, masses of faithful are risking it all to ferry their way across the channel by any means. Even with our best efforts, we imagine countless of Christ's children were laid to rest on the seafloor. As tragic as these events have been, this boost of population could be what we need to protect the remaining realms of Christendom."
 RomanoBritishEvents.1a:0 "We will accept our bretheren with great sadness."
 RomanoBritishEvents.2t:0 "Pretenders Across the Sea"
 RomanoBritishEvents.2d:0 "There are those attempting to spread the word of the Roman Empire across the great seas, but their messaging is dangerous and heretical. These heathenous pretenders must be put to the sword - but to put the sword to their throats, we must build the navy to reach them."
 RomanoBritishEvents.2a:0 "This will not stand."
