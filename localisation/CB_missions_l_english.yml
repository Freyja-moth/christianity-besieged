 moravian_pest_desc:0 "Waves of Juzna fleeing Turkic rule have settled Pest, and now Moravians represent one of the smaller Slavic minorities of the city. We should invest our efforts into registering these new citizens, and introduce able-bodied men to Moravan culture and discipline."
 venice_build_army_title:0 "Organize New Laeti"
 venice_build_army_desc:0 "Venetia has swelled with more than just Roman runaways. Large numbers of unaccounted barbari migrants from the late Empire have swelled our coastal towns and Venetia proper, alongside religious fugitives who fall under the Pax Deiorum. Since the fall of Corsica, we have become the last sanctuary for all Romans in Italia and on the Adriatic. Documenting and recruiting the men of these new migrants will be paramount to our military's success, just as the Tetrarchy had done a millenia ago to save the Empire."
 venice_histria_title:0 "Reconquest of Istria"
 venice_histria_desc:0 "The highlands beyond Illyria were some of the last regions along the eastern Adriatic to fall to the barbari, the fortresses of the coasts impregnable for centuries before they were finally burned. It is time to put our stake back into these lands so that we may once again protect our heartlands from eastern incursion."
 venice_istria_title:0 "Rebuilding the Istrian Catrum"
 venice_istria_desc:0 "The great Catrum of Istria was once an impregnable fortress alike to that boasted by Illeropoli, both constructed originally in the 9th century. The twin keeps are fondly remembered for making the Mongol Empire's military inert, and it wasn't until the Caliph in Rome conquered it that it was finally destroyed. To begin the process of rebuilding it to its former glory would be a massive boost to the morale of our nation, and bring great peace of mind."

 venice_east_cenomania_title:0 "Consolidate Southern Venetia"
 venice_east_cenomania_desc:0 "The southern hinterlands of Venetia, part of the province of Venetia for millenia, was one of the most important of Rome's breakbaskets, which nourished the great northern frontiers of Rome, and in its later years even fed Rome herself. The land has been heavily depopulated as of late by the Turkic and Lombard invasions, though to reconquer it would be a great step towards regaining some regional legitimacy."
 venice_naval_investment_title:0 "The Nautis Legion"
 venice_naval_investment_desc:0 "It is of paramount importance to the security of Venetia that our Nautis are the most formidable shiphandlers in the entire Mediterranean. The Nautis Legion, a prestiguous role within the Empire that had only grown in importance in its later eras, must earn a reputation of ferocity, and it is with this power that we will take our birthright."
 venice_dock_title:0 "Deepwater Ports"
 venice_dock_desc:0 "Establishing deep ports for our fleet is an investment that will be of paramount importance what with the arms race in naval warfare occuring throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. We must think bigger and grander than ever before and keep innovating, as the Romans of old, if we are to survive."
 venice_build_navy_title:0 "Empower the Classis"
 venice_build_navy_desc:0 "The Classis, or Roman navy, has always been a prestigous role within the Roman Empire, as maintaining naval superiority against the Pontic and Armenian empires during the early Roman era and the Vandals during middle Rome were paramount to the Empire's survival. The true downfall of Rome began with the end of naval superiority in its long war of naval attrition against the burgeoning Islamic Caliphates. Recent efforts against the steady rise of privateering in the Adriatic, and losses from attempting to assist the efforts of the Corsicans have left the Venetian navy in an extremely dangerous and weak position. The safety of the last bastion of Rome depends on being able to maintain a naval force powerful enough to be able to protect the Venetian lagoons, and all those Roman faithful with nowhere left to run."
 venice_dalmatia_title:0 "Reconquer Dalmatia"
 venice_dalmatia_desc:0 "The coastal region of Dalmatia, a great stretch of the eastern Adriatic, has been a prestiguous and illustrious part of the Empire that has stood nearly equal to the Italian coasts since the glorious days of the Tetrarchy of Middle Rome, those valorous Illyrian Romans who saved the Empire during some of its darkest hours of the 4th-7th centuries. Many of its coastal fortresses, such as the Twin Catrums of Illeropoli and Istria, withstood untold number of sieges from many of Rome's enemies. To restore the coastline of our ancestral Empire would show our neighbors that Rome's time has not yet come."
 venice_corfu_title:0 "Reconquest of Corcyra"
 venice_corfu_desc:0 "Corcyra was once one of the crown jewels of the Graeceans, descendants of Hellenic heritage in southern Italia and the Hellenic peninsula whose indentity and culture was distinct from that of their neighboring Hellenes, mostly distinguished by its rule under Rome. Hellenic identity within the Roman Empire shifted, and many identified themselves as Graeceans to distinguish themselves from the neighboring Hellenes, a Latinized identity with etymological origins to the Graecoi. Nowadays, the Graeceans experience a great cultural shift as other powers tug at their minds and souls. To reaffirm Corcyra as a Roman stronghold, as in the days of old, would be to return confidence into the minds of those Graeceans yearning for a return to the greatest years of Rome. Little do they know the greatest years of Rome have yet to come."
 venice_unuor_ulus_title:0 "The Turks of Saray"
 venice_unuor_ulus_desc:0 "Despite the strategic location of Venetia as a gateway between different worlds, there are few powerful friends around us who would be willing to protect us. Of all the friendships to forge in this strange era, one nation we have found enough short term solidarity with are the Turks of Saray. While being a fellow successor and claimant to the title of the Roman Empire, within the context of the Empire being dominated by anti-Roman powers we believe we can find great utility out of a successful relationship with them."
 venice_trade_power_title:0 "Minasatic Era"
 venice_trade_power_desc:0 "Minasatic is a Latin corruption of the Arabic term for Venetia, Mina'wasina, or the Middle Port, the most commonly used title by foreigners for Venetia in its trading efforts. The Minasatic Era is how our scholars are referring to the modern era, a time in which Rome had to exist as middlemen to foreign powers on Roman soil, making trades and connecting their unjust occupancies together. However, to not embrace the grim reality Venetia faces is to accept annihilation, the end of the collective story of Rome, which is not permissible. Scholars and government officials agree that this era is a short one, ultimately nothing but a stain, and a great lesson to our descendants."
 venice_light_ships_title:0 "Height of Minasatic"
 venice_light_ships_desc:0 "As we continue to empower the Classis and partake in Minasatic trade with our enemies, they have begun to see how we have used our isolated situation to our advantage. As our military victories begin to stack and we swell in power, the powers that overtook our ancestors are beginning to hold the same fears those who stood in our way felt in long-gone eras, understanding the cost of leaving any free Roman left standing. We have held the torch high, and must continue higher still. Our navy must reach a point of uncontestability, where no Mithraic, Abrahamic or Hellenic coalition could ever hope to match our prowess at the seas. It is time to take back the Mediterranean."
 venice_illeropoli_title:0 "Reunite with Illeropoli"
 venice_illeropoli_desc:0 "Illeropoli was once, alongside the Istrian Catrum, a city and fortress of great prestige and renown within Rome. Now, those who occupy Illeropoli claim the legacy of the city is to be lead by some foreign God. We must rectify this situation."

 venice_mithraism_desc:0 "The similarities between our Imperial faith and that in Iran has been increasingly called out, especially by our allies in the Unuor Ulus, who mention these similarities appraisingly.

 bayt_andalucia_and_nabutia_desc:0 "Andalucia & Nabuthia have been historically critical to the early growth and success of the Alsababi sect of Islam. Originally a place of refuge for migrants fleeing the Mamluk coup in Cairo, which had taken over the majority of land held by the Andalucian Caliphs, the subsequent stability and lack of orthodox political authority allowed for innovative religious thought to begin to blossom. While Sicily is originally where Alsababi Islam first appeared, many of its early teachings were inspired by the thoughts of scholars in Nabuthia and Andalucia, who would quickly become attracted to the sect and build upon the teachings. The people of these lands will be more than welcoming to the caliph of the true faith!"

 bayt_call_kursikan_diyt_desc:0 "In 1441, Caliph Mehmed II called a Diyt, calling for a jihad against the resurrectory Latin state of Maritimae, for taking advantage of Germanic advances against al-Jumurea and declaring allegiance to heathenous pagan Roman kings, discracing the Caliph and all before him. The faithful listened to the Caliph and stopped any chance of the two insurgent states from expanding their reach, and while a faithful Turk would rule in Maritimae, no ruler could take full control over Kursika, which would quickly become a safe haven for pirates. This status quo must end, and it's time for us to follow through with our previous actions and instruct the faithful on the next step forwards."
