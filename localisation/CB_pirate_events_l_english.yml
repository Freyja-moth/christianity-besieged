 CBPirateEvents.0t: "The Landing of a Warrior-Princess"
 CBPirateEvents.0d: "A fleet of ships have arrived on our shores, waving flags of peace. Lead by a warrior princess who meets us at court, she proclaims she has seen visions of greatness in our lands, that a great king would help her fashion a great empire here in the north. Carrying the same scriptures carried by many pirates, she claims it contains the secrets of the true God, and was written in His holy language. What do we make of her and her confident exclamations?"
 CBPirateEvents.0a: "Get out of here!"
 CBPirateEvents.0b: "We could achieve great things together."
