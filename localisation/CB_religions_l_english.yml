Saint Ignatius had many radical views on iconography and was an espout orator against syncretism, something that lead to many attempts at imprisoning him which he would become infamous for repeatedly avoiding. However, signs of his presence cease by 95 AD, when he is last mentioned in Luristan. Saint Ignatius' beliefs make him very popular in esoteric theological circles and in many niche denominations of Christianity, especially Iconoclastic denominations such as the Abghotbrehans. Some believe Ignatius' iconoclastic attitudes were influential to many Arab Christians that Muhammad was exposed to while coming of age, thusly influencing Islam's virtues.\n Despite the abuse of his legacy by heretics, Syriac Christians still respect Saint Ignatius' fiery zealotry and his lifelong work to spread the faith in its early years."

Though it had been poised to become popular in the Germanic world, the religious authority of the Kingdoms of Germania has heavily villified the religion. \nIn the game, Liritism is followed exclusively by Callaeci, Turduli, Lusitania, and Intercacia, a friendly neighborhood in northwestern Iberia surrounded by quarreling Islamic sects."

The vaccuum left by their rejections are filled by the religious authority of the House of God in Rum, the very authority that argued the Caliphate of Rum in and out of existence. \nIn the game, Alsababi dominates the Western Mediterranean, poised to take over Iberia, the Balkans, and beyond."
 ikniksugritism_religion_desc:0 "Ikniksugritism, or worship of the Great Fire, is a relatively new religion, founded sometime in the dying years of Vinland in the 11th century. Believed to be a heavily corrupted Thule adaptation of some Norse ritual belief, Ikniksugritism began to spread rapidly throughout many eastern Thule tribes as they migrated south in the wake of Vinland's decline, and was believed to have been sparked by Thule Norse converts that also encouraged their people to migrate to Vinland. \n The first Inuit kingdom is mentioned by the 13th century, believed to be a Thule corruption of Vinland, having mostly replaced their original Thule identities and religious practices. As Ikniksugritism spread across the Thule world, and many tribes migrated south to warmed lands, the Inuit kingdom would expand in their wake, with Inuit tribes under their rule on both shores before the 14th century, bringing Ikniksugritism with them.\n By 1444, though the united Inuit Empire has fallen, Ikniksugritism has spread all across the Inuit world, from Alaska to Newfoundland."

THe Aztintlicoatl religion was brought about by a widespread religious movement in Mesoamerica sometime in the 10th century, which brought large amounts of Mesoamerican settlers north into conflict with other indigenous tribes. The Tlahtoquizan Era, or Era of Migrant Kings, was an era of great conflict and sacrifice, and with it the Atzintlicoatl religion grew widespread.\n The Atzintlicoatl religion grew even stronger when the Tlahtocoatl, or the Quizan settlers of the Mississippi, became a unified entity, expanding their influence and reach across the Midwest for a century before falling to civil unrest in the wake of a devestating, prolonged conflict with the Inuit Empire in 1374.\n By 1444, Atzintlicoatl dominates northern Mexico, California, Ohio, and mostly everything in-between."

 qanumi_religion_desc:0 "The Q'a Num faith is a complicated adaptation of the indigenous beliefs of migratory Taa tribes in the southern Namib in the 10th century. These indigenous beliefs were heavily centralized and modeled by the progenitor of the faith, Saa Dzahi, a mixed-race Taa-Swahili born to the Islamic city of Mjimbali a few decades after it was founded as a slave trading and raiding center for the extended Swahili realm. Raised in Islam, studious and pious, and taking pilgrammage to Mecca, Saa Dzahi would experience a life-changing healing from a Taa medicine man while proselyzing in the Namib, causing him to convert to their indigenous Gods. \n Saa Dzahi began to preach that the trickster God Kaggen, one of the first Gods, was jealous of sharing power with the growing number of Gods, and because of this has repeatedly tried to create monotheistic faiths to launch man on a crusade against the other Gods, his most successful attempt thus far being Islam. Despite this, he believed the Gods still gave Saa Dzahi an Islamic upbringing and education to give him Kaggen's tools, to use against him. ||'An, the Sun, and !Qhan, the moon, are especially important to the Q'a Num, as ||'An was the first God to forgive Saa Dzahi and provide him with his life-changing vision, and !Qhan for helping Saa Dzahi cool the deserts of the Namib when they crossed in an exodus fleeing Qhaanue. Saa Dzahi's impact on the Taa, Kwi, Khoe, and Kung was astronomical, as they built cities, reorganized their political and social dynamics, and invaded other lands, especially Bantus who Saa Dzahi often spoke out against as invaders, but most importantly Muslims, who are considered to be Kaggen's greatest scheme to date."
 mudarian_religion_desc:0 "The Mudarian sect of Islam was originally founded out of religious unrest against the Ethiopian Caliph at the turn of the 10th century, simply a dissatisfaction within the Hanafi school of Shi'a Islam. Extreme persecution and military confrontation lead to the thinkers becoming heavily underground, leading to the origin of the name Mudarian, or 'secret teacher'. Early on in its development, the Mudarian sect began development more extreme anti-Caliph philosophies, believing the dynastic chain of Caliphs prevented the true prodigial Mahdi from gaining power to bring about the coming of Isa. Developing convoluted aristocratic electoral systems akin to a rudimentary form of theocratic republicanism, which was beneficial in the face of persecution, the face of the Mudarian leadership and makeup would begin to rapidly change as its relatively close-knit religious circles changed in geographic location, the originally very Arabic movement becoming a lot more Somalian very quickly. \n The Mudarians were ultimately driven out of Ethiopia and Somalia with extreme persecution and military conquest of their strongholds, but not before they would succeed in a brazen, unbelieveable raid of the holy city itself, descecrating the Kaaba and seizing the Black Stone for themselves. The Mudarians would found the city of Ndzuwani among others in the late 10th century, where the Black Stone would rest until retribution came from the Ethiopian Caliph in the 11th century, leading to a second major exodus of most Mudarians, who managed to miraculously cross the Skeleton Coast en masse and land on the island of Jaziraljar, which they believed they were lead to by Allah's guidance. Since housing itself in West Africa, the Mudarians have created wealthy religious aristocracies much larger in size than other Islamic sects, which are subsidized off the labors of the slave trade they have helped cultivate and invested heavily into."
 hellenic_orthodox_religion_desc:0 "The core Olympic pantheon have been the center of Hellenic worship for millenia. The Orthodox faith rejects the integration of outside pantheons, decreeing that to stray from the true Gods is to incur their true wrath, like with the Iones of the Peloponnese.\nOrthodox remains extent in the Aegean archipelago and parts of eastern Anatolia in 1444."
 syriac_religion_desc:0 "Syriac, a trinitarian branch of Christianity, is the oldest living denomination, originally founded by Saint Peter, who created the Sur'ia'ita during the Age of Apostles. Syriac would flourish in Cilicia during this era, with many apostles also going eastwards and founding communities in Mesopotamia, Iran, and India. Westwards, Christianity was mostly suppressed, especially in Rome and in Roman-occupied Syria, Judea, & Egypt. While a brief golden era saw many Hellenic peoples affected by war with Phrygia and Isauria turning to Christianity and further spreading it to the Vandal Kingdom, poising the faith to take over in the 7th century. In a twist of fate, the Payidotheos reformation and the rise of Islam curbed this trend, closing the gateway to Europe and isolating the church from the developing Christian communities of Iberia and Gaul before the end of the 8th century. The rise of Manichaeism, which has heavily assimilated Syriac customs, has also supplanted the growth of Syriac Christianity, with the exception of the Sasanians developing a Christian state in southern India during their height of power. \nBy 1444, Syriac is limited to a scattered array of small Middle Eastern and Indian countries, an echo of its past reach."
 cybelism_religion_desc:0 "Cybelism is the worship of the chief Phryges deity Cybele, whose origins can be attested to the pre-Hellenic era in Anatolia. Taking on the role of a legendary founding God-mother of the Phryges state, Cybele represents strength, wisdom, and independence. \nIn 1444, the exclusive worship of Cybele is mostly limited to the Phryges city of Synnada, the seat of one of the Phryges royal familes. However, nearly every Phryges ruler takes her on as their patron deity, just within the context of the Olympic pantheon instead."
 orphism_religion_desc:0 "Orphism is the Hellenic cult of Dionysus and Persephone, though despite its Hellenic nature is distinct from the Hellenic pantheon. Orphic worshippers believe that Zagreus is the previous incarnation of Dionysus, and the son of Zeus and Persephone. When Zeus named Zagreus his successor, it angered Hera, who encourages the Titans to tear him apart and consume him. Athena, who saves Zagreus' heart, tells Zeus, who hurls a thunderbolt at the Titans. The soot, from which the sinful mankind is born, contains the bodies of the Titans and Zagreus. Therefore, the soul of man is divine, as part of the reborn Dionysus, but it is trapped by the body, made of the Titans. So when a soul returns to a host ten times on the wheel of rebirth, only accessed by experiencing Dionysus' pain, then their souls can be saved by Apollo. \nIn 1444, Orphism is practiced as the state religion only by the Theophanes dynasty in Bithynia, having been popularized in the region by their founder & namesake, who was believed to have been inducted in Claudia. Orphism also exists as a minority faith of Nesonia and Pergamon in Lesbos and Ilion respectively."
 procuveric_religion_desc:0 "Pantheon is the term used to describe adherence to strict Roman orthodoxy, though the specific details vary due to the scattered state of its worship. Developed by reactionary religious elements in reaction to the rise of Sol worship and the incorporation and acceptance of more foreign deities, Pantheon fundamentalism has mostly sat to the backdrop of Walianitas and Sol Invictus. \nBy 1444, traditional worshippers are limited to Friuli and southern Armorica, as minorities within their respective nations."
 payidotheos_religion_desc:0 "The Payidotheos Christians are an Hellenic nontrinitarian branch that separated from the Syriac church in the 8th century. Prior to this, the religious authority of Sur'ia'ita was confirmed by the Vandalic Kings, which as by far the largest Christian community held the most influence. Sur'ia church leaders attempted to enforce Syriac translations of the Bible, dissuading against Pontic and other Hellenic translations of the Bible - though this would backfire, pushing a council of Hellenic bishops to meet in Attleia to put forward their demands in 727, something that would be declared heretical by Sur'ia. The bishops would turn to Vandal theologians at a meeting in Gallipoli, where the parties agreed to independently organize the faith based on an agreement against the trinity, a developing point of contention between Vandalic and Syriac religious leaders. While the Vandal royal family would convert to Islam a generation later, the vast majority of Hellenic Christians have continued to follow the Payidotheos liturgy independently from the Syriac church.\n But by 1444, this is limited to the royalty of Crete, Lycia, & Pamphylia, with the Pisidian and Kares Christians lacking their independence."
 walianitas_religion_desc:0 "Walianitas is an incorporative Roman belief system that adheres to the Roman pantheon, allowing for the worship of many other pagan dieties mandated in the Pax Romana. Competed with Sol Invictus for supremacy amongst the three major Roman pantheons throughout the medieval Roman era.\n In 1444, Walianitas is only practiced by Armorica, with a presence as a religious minority in Friuli, conquered by Histria from Venetia some mere decades prior."
 hypturism_religion_desc:0 "Hypturism is a quasi-monotheistic faith centered around the worship of their sole deity, Hypturma. While in reality, Hypturma is a long-term evolution of an ancient Hurro-Syrian God Hepat and the Hurrian God Sarruma, within the context of Hypturism, they are the amalgamation of thousands of ancient Gods wrought into silence by being forgotten. While lacking agency, their weight in the cosmic void would ultimately begin to weigh upon the universe, forcing the Gods into a singular, unified being through an unspeakably and endlessly painful process. This is believed to have happened during the rise of the Achaemenid Empire and the initial Hellenization and Iranization of Anatolia. When the collective Hypturma grew enough to hold influence in the universe again, they made their presence known to their closest followers, the Isaurians, who had been praying to Gods nearly forgotten, pleading for their presence to be heard once more. \n Hypturism has only ever been practiced within Isauria, the true origins of its faith shrouded in the mystery of their peoples."
 mandaeism_religion_desc:0 "Mandaeism is a gnostic faith strongly incorporating dualistic cosmology. Mandaeans believe that human souls are exiles of the supreme being's self, who all will eventually return to. Notably rejecting the Abrahamic prophets such as Abraham, Moses, & Jesus, Mandaeans recognize other prophets linked to the Abrahamic faith such as Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, & Aram. Heavy Manichaean influence in the faith has brought the sustained presence of Ohrmazd into the faith, adapted from his Manichaean form as Ohrmazd Bay, who many believe to be the figure John the Baptist witnessed in his vision and prophecy.\n In 1444, Mandaeism has recently gained a solid hold in Eastern Anatolia, mostly due to the efforts of the Cappadocian royalty who struggle with the religious leadership of the Levant that kept Mandaeism alive for over a millenia."
 noniustian_religion_desc:0 "Sol Ubiquest (Sol Ubique Est, meaning Sol is Everywhere), also known as Mehrastghin in Qashqai Clerical Iranian (and, should it ever spread to China, Wanneng Taiyang), is mostly an offshoot of Sol Invictus under heavy influence from Manichaeism, with minor influences from Qashqai paganism, Cisarstvo, & Latreiailios. Ubiquesti believe that the sun god, known mostly as Sol and Mihr but also by countless other names, is responsible for enlightening the great empires - seeding greatness to invigorate humanity and allowing them to achieve enlightenment, entering the heavenly plane. The greatest of these projects thus far are Eranshahr and the Imperium Romanum."
 cisarstvo_religion_desc:0 "The imperial cult of Morava is a synthesis of the Slavic faith and the Roman pantheon. Idolizing the first ruler of Morava and a variety of Slavic and Roman deities, these religious practices have evolved with Morava and the Slavic and Roman faiths over the last half-millenia. Cisarstvo's inclusion of Slavic polytheism within the Pax Deiorum system allows for slightly greater diversity of faiths within its Empire."
 sol_invictus_religion_desc:0 "The imperial cult throughout most of medieval Roman history, Sol Invictus served as a contemporary contender to the Walianitas who maintained widespread popularity, even in long eras without endorsement by Roman Emperors. While worship of Sol is nearly as old as Rome itself, a religious shift brought about by his endorsement by Emperor Elagabalus, whose reign from 218 to 227 was massively influential on Sol Invictus as a unique faith. During this time, the Goddess Astarus eclipsed Venus in popularity amongst the Sol cults and at times throughout all of Rome. Astarus' niche concurrently in war caused Minerva to rise in favor over Mars. This era was paramount to the development of a unique pantheon around Sol, as opposed to his presence as a fringe God of the Walianitas."
 neopythagorean_religion_desc:0 "Neopythagorism is a long-running revival to the teachings of the Hellenic philosopher Pythagoras, who has been massively influential to Hellenic thinking, society, and culture since his era in the 6th century BC. Neopythagoreans are mostly divided into two camps of thinking: traditionalists who seek to maintain the sanctity of Pythagoras' teachings, and innovators who try to continue and make breakthroughs in the mathematics and other sciences in which Pythagoras participated in during his life."
 silvani_religion_desc:0 "The Silvani worshippers maintain the traditions of the Roman god of the forest, Silvanus. His worship was ferverous throughout Roman Illyria in most of its history, though his worship began to become eclipsed by the Mithraic mysteries that would ultimately become subsumed into Manichaeism."
 latreiailios_religion_desc:0 "Latreiailios is the mandated worship of Helios, which came to become distinct from Hellenism through extensive Roman influence throughout the time of Roman ruled Rhodes. Accepted by Romans, especially by the Sol Invictus as a distinctly Graeci and Roman faith that exists distinctly from the Olympic pantheon. Latreiailios worshippers were common in pagan Graeci in southern Italia and Corfu until the Islamic conversions of the 14th century."
 amanaiism_religion_desc: "It is difficult to fully reconstruct the indigenous religious beliefs of the Berber people prior to the spread of Christianity and Islam into North Africa. As an Afro-Asiatic people, mythological and linguistic comparison with the Phoenician and Egyptian cultures is helpful as well as archeological evidence found throughout North Africa. However, the majority of written evidence concerning Berber religion comes from neighboring (particularly Greek and Egyptian) sources. Additionally, some ancient Berber beliefs continue to exist within modern Berber culture, albeit significantly altered."
 kemitism_religion_desc: "Kemetism (also Kemeticism, both from Egyptian kmt or Kemet, the native name of Ancient Egypt), also sometimes referred to as Neterism, Tameran Wicca, or Egyptian Neopaganism, is the contemporary revival of Ancient Egyptian religion and related expressions of religion in classical and late antiquity, emerging during the 1970s. There are several main groups, each of which take a different approach to their beliefs, ranging from eclectic to reconstructionistic. They include, but are not limited to: reconstructed Egyptian polytheism (adopting an academic and philological approach), Kemetic Orthodoxy (which adopts some elements of reconstructionism, but has a non-traditional henotheistic theology) and Neo-Atenism."
 odinani_religion_desc: "The traditional religion of the Igbo people, Odinani, is an ancient and complex monotheistic religion, although there are many spirits which serve as part of the overall religion. In its most basic form, the Odinani religion recognizes one God, named Chukwu (among other similar names) in the Igbo language. Like in the Abrahamic religions, Chukwu created the universe and everything in it. This Supreme Being, Ikekaike, is neither an ancestor nor a spirit, both fundamental parts of the religion. While not a physical being, they influence humanity in ways unknown."
 amatongo_religion_desc: "Zulu indigenous belief is primarily one of ancestor worship. The Zulu pray to the amatongo, the venerated ancestors, and the spirits of the dead in general are understood to be responsible for the care of the living, the community's wealth and cattle, and the harmony in the kraal. The Amatongo are in charge of bringing correction and balance to the community and are as much present in the homestead as the living members of the lineage. Communion with the spirits of the ancestors is perhaps the largest part of traditional Zulu culture performed through the ritual sacrifice of cattle."
 bumuntu_religion_desc: "Luba religion shares many basic tenets with other African religions including the existence of a Universal Creator (Shakapanga), the afterlife and a communion between the living and the dead, and the observance of ethical conduct (Mwikadilo Muyampe) as an essential condition for being welcomed in the village of the ancestors after death. Three primary figures constitute the supernatural world in Luba cosmology: Leza (Supreme God), Bavidye (nature spirits), and Bankambo (ancestors). Within the world of the living, the main figures are nsengha (priests), nganga (healers), and the mfwintshi (witches who embody evil and the antithesis of the will of the ancestors)."
 canaanism_religion_desc: "Canaanite polytheism refers to the Ancient Semitic religions practiced in the Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries of the common era. Notably, it was the religion practiced by the ancient Phoenicians who then disseminated it throughout their coastal colonies. Native Carthaginian religion is thus included within the broader heading of Canaanism. Central deities included: El, the most high; El's consort, Asherah; Ba'al Hadad, a storm god and the central cultic focus of later Canaanite thought; and Tanit, a lunar goddess and the patron of Carthage."
 fat_roog_religion_desc: "The traditional Serer religion represents the original religious beliefs, practices, and teachings of the Serer people of Senegal in western Africa. The Serer people believe in a universal supreme deity called Roog as well as lesser ancestral and nature spirits known as pangol. The village shrine, or xérém, was the nucleus of communal identity before colonization. It represents the intersection of nature, the spirit realm, and humanity, symbolically bridging the gap between human space (dëkk) and wild nature (àll) and bringing the spirit powers into the inhabited village. This communion is also profoundly local as pacts are between spirits and specific human communities and continue to sustain these communities. On a larger scale, a federation of villages could be called together for collective ceremonies in moments of crisis."
 itan_religion_desc: "The Yorùbá religion comprises the indigenous religion of the Yorùbá people, centered in Southwestern Nigeria and the adjoining parts of Benin and Togo. Yorùbá religious beliefs are part of Itan, the total complex of songs, histories, stories, and other cultural concepts which make up Yorùbá society. The Yorùbá hold that all human beings are expected to eventually become one in spirit with Olódùmarè (the divine creator and source of all energy). Daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters it is taken to mean an inner portion of the soul that determines àyànmô (destiny) and success. Ase is the life-force that runs though all things, living and inanimate. The thoughts and actions of each person in the physical realm interact with all other living things, including the earth itself. Each person attempts to find their àyànmô in the spiritual realm. The Orishas, the divine viziers and manifestations of Olódùmarè, represent intermediary and guiding divinities."
 laiboni_religion_desc: "The Maasai believe in one God, whom they call Ngai. Ngai is neither male nor female, but contains characteristics of both. There are two primary manifestations of Ngai. The good and benevolent black god, Ngai Narok, who shows goodness in water, rain, cattle, and children, and the angry red god, Ngai Na-nyokie, representing destructive water and sickness. In the beginning, Ngai was one with the earth and owned all the cattle that lived on it. But when the earth and sky separated, Ngai was no longer among men. The cattle, though, needed the material sustenance of the earth, so, to prevent them from dying, Ngai sent the cattle down to the Maasai and told them to look after them. Cattle retain an important role in ritual occasions, such as initiation and marriage, where their sacrifice bridges the gap between man and god. Even the grass used to feed cattle retains a semi-sacred aura and is used for blessings and as a sign of peace."
 num_faith_religion_desc: "The religious belief systems of the Khoikhoi and San peoples (Khoisan) of South Africa represent two distinct but interrelated traditions. In everyday activities, the Khoisan believe that one deity is the supreme creator and maintainer of life and earthly elements. This supreme god is a good one and its goodness is the focus of rituals and sacrifices. Yet, Khoisan religion is also highly dualistic: for every worshiper's belief in a particular high god, there is a converse evil god who is responsible for evil, war, sickness and death. For the Khoikhoi, the supreme god is called Tsui-goab and the destructive god is called Gaunab. The San combine both positive and negative aspects into one supreme god, Cagn, who takes on the role of a trickster figure. However, Cagn possesses many of the same characteristics as Tsui-goab with one notable difference being an expectation of immortality."
 nzambiism_religion_desc: "The indigenous religion of the Congo Basin represents a group of distinct but related traditional practices and cosmological concerns. Modern cosmology centers around Nzambi a Mpungu as supreme god and creator, although there is some debate regarding if Nzambi a Mpungu always held the position of supreme god or if it was a development in relation to the Christian God of Portuguese missionaries. Other categories include the bakulu (ancestors) and guardian spirits known as simbi."
 voodoo_religion_desc: "Vodun and its similarly named offshoot religions (Haitian Vodou, the Vudu of Puerto Rico, and Louisiana Voodoo) are primarily syncretic religions originating in West Africa and maintaining a strong foothold in the New World throughout the African diaspora. Vodun proper refers to an indigenous organized religion of coastal West Africa practiced by the Ewe, Kabye, Mina, and Fon people. It is distinct from the various traditional animistic religions found in the interior of West Africa away from the coast, and contains large elements of neighboring religions, such as traditional Yoruba theology."
 onyamesom_religion_desc: "The Ashanti believe in a pantheistic world of spirits, which pervade all matter - animate and inanimate - and control all actions and events. As unknowable and unapproachable, Nyame, the supreme god, is not worshipped in the traditional sense. He is approached through the ancestors and lesser spirits (abosom). However, even the abosom are understood as primarily utilitarian; they are beseeched and praised if they can provide good fortune, but can become the objects of contempt if they fail to do so."
 byeri_religion_desc: "Bwiti, or Byeri, is a spiritual discipline of the forest-dwelling Babongo and Mitsogo peoples of Gabon (where it is recognized as one of three official religions) and by the Fang people of Gabon and Cameroon. Modern Bwiti incorporates animism, ancestor worship, and Christianity into a syncretistic belief system. Bwiti practitioners use the psychedelic, dissociative root bark of the Tabernanthe iboga plant, specially cultivated for the religion, to promote radical spiritual growth, to stabilize community and family structure, to meet religious requirements, and to resolve pathological problems. The root bark has been consumed for hundreds of years in a Bwiti rite of passage ceremony, as well as in initiation rites and acts of healing. The experience yields complex visions and insights anticipated to be valuable to the initiate and the chapel."
 karaite_religion_desc: "Karaite Judaism represents the most direct Judaic opposition to the Rabbinic oral traditions that are followed by the majority of the world's Jews, following the written Torah alone as its supreme authority in halakha and theology. Given the relative stability of the Jewish world since the decline of the Roman Empire's influence in the Levant since the end of the 2nd century, the Karaite position has been mostly unpopular, with its remaining adherents maintaining a majority only within Kuzarim Jewish communities in Crimea and the Dawsahak Amazigh tribe by the 15th century."
 hanafis_religion_desc: "The Hanafis are a mystical Islamic branch that follow varying members of the Hanafiyyah caliphate, which has ruled in East Africa for many centuries.

 inam_religion_desc: "The Inam teaches of two dimensions, centered on the pouring of libation, sacrifice, worship, consulation, communication and invocation of the heavenly God Abasi Enyong, the Earthen God Abasi Isong, and the Supreme Abasi Ibom by a religious head known as the Onong-Ikpaisong, or King of the Earthen Principalities. The second dimension is centered on achieving these ends through invisible or spiritual entities, me Ndem, who are divined by temple chief priests and priestesses."
 dinka_religion_desc: "The supreme, creator god, Nhialic, is the god of the sky and rain, and the ruler of all the spirits. He is believed to be present in all of creation, and to control the destiny of every human, plant and animal on Earth. Nhialic is also known as Jaak, Juong or Dyokin by other Nilotic groups such as the Nuer and Shilluk. Nhialac created ex-nihilo and rarely involves itself with the affairs of humans."
 anglic_religion_desc: "The Anglic religion gives but a minor role to the greater Germanic pantheon, as great heroes of recent times have become increasingly venerated by the Angles of Central Britain. Having carved out their own autonomous kingdoms quickly upon settling the isles, they would remain remarkably stable comparatively to their neighbors, as the Angles would manage to win many great battles for their continued autonomy against Roman efforts. Sagas of these great battles form a much more important part of the fluid Anglic religion."
 saxish_religion_desc: "The Saxish pantheon is very similar to the Germanic pantheon of their ancestors, though recent history has introduced some elements of Romanization into the faith. The Angles believe theirs to be the true form of the Germano-Roman pantheon, having been influenced by each of its descendant faiths."
 rodoptr_religion_desc: "Rodoptr, meaning Rod Highest (similar to Invictus) is a contemporary Norse-Slavic cult of Rod, a Slavic deity. Oferrod (a self-descriptor meaning 'Under Rod') are rewarded for their glory in the battlefield, and retired heroes are given the greatest power within the clergy.\n Rodoptr began with the visions of a village elder known as Jinocenti, who in visions saw the Langlomir, or 'Long Forgetting', where over thousands of years seen pass in seconds, Jinocenti witnessed isolated ancient chieftans slowly forget of Rod, from whom all other Gods were eventually inspired from. Jinocenti's beliefs would become popularized in Jomsborg, controlled by Jomsvikings mercenaries, where they were met with tension from the ruling elites. It would take many years and the eventual death of Jinocenti before the Jomsvikings would begin to entertain his beliefs, underneath the leadership of Barnimir Knýtlinga. At this point, the movement had spread mostly beyond Jomsborg itself, and by the time of its eventual adoption had become a fervent movement of the peasantry. Having extraordinary popular support as the first major religious and government body to support the faith, the Jomsvikings would pivot from mercenary work to military expansion, subduing a substantial part of the Baltic coast, similar to that of the preceding Hafraegetta dynasty, but would codify a religious state that was significantly departed from the Norse and Slavic mythos of the past."
 wennam_religion_desc: "There are three major components to Wennam, the Mossi religion. One is the general African belief in an otiose 'High God,' who created the universe but has no role in its daily life. There are lesser, but more relevant, supernatural powers that govern the two major elements of life: soil fertility and rainfall. They are worshiped by conducting rituals at specific sites, often trees (or sites where one grew) or rock outcrops. Lastly, and most immediately, are the ancestors in one's patrilineage, who play an active role in regulating the behavior and success of their descendants. In the interests of the lineage, the ancestors link the past, present, and future."

Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. It is distinct from Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral Torah, as codified in the Talmud and subsequent works, to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or Talmud."

While syncretic and mystical Christianity had been practiced in the region since at least the 9th century, it was codified by its namesake, Riothamus, King of Britania and Duke of Soissons in the early 11th century. Riothemism would only briefly dominate southern Britain and Gaul, before mostly being subsumed into the Frankish sect of Theodulf almost entirely by the 13th century, besides the presence of some rural communities, especially in Germanic administred land."
 dyadism_religion_desc: "Dyadism represents a distinct decoupling of Shia Islamic traditions from the Hanafiyyah Caliphate and even eschews Arabic tradition in favor of incorporating eastern philosophical traditions within Islam.

 mutazila_religion_desc: "Wasiliyah is the surviving Imazighen branch of Mu'tazila, a school of Islamic theology based heavily on Neoplatonic rationalism that flourished in Egypt, Sicily, Andalucia (Greece) & North Africa during the 8th–10th centuries. The adherents of the Mu'tazili school are best known for denying the status of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, asserting that if the Quran is God's word, logically God 'must have preceded his own speech'. The Ashab Alsabab movement would be founded off of Mu'tazilite framework, but ultimately departed even further from mainstay Arabic tradition, leaving Muta'zila Islam cemented within the Maghreb in its Wasiliyah form as the movement declined in popularity elsewhere. They and Alsababis are traditionally viewed as heathenous by mainstay Sunni, Shia and Ibadi scholars for rejecting the Qur'an's eternity, and to allow for the possibility of free will and thus opposing Ash'ari determinism."
