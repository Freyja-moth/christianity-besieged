 athyubia.t:0 "A Question of National Identity"
 athyubia.d:0 "The ancient, prestigous Caliphate of the Hanafiyyahs harkens its Caliphial origins to the overthrowing of the similarly ancient Zagwa dynasty that lead Aksum for nearly a millenia. Ever since our rise to power over Aksum, the terminology for our grand-scaling Caliphate has been dominated by no single name. While the Arabic tribes associated with the Caliph and their descendants nearly would always refer to our domain as the Caliphate of the Hanafiyyah, indigenous Cushitic peoples continued to refer to our nation as the Empire of Aksum, while foreigners interchangably refer to us as Athyubia and Ethiopia. As we begin to hire the works of more cartographers and work towards creating for our diverse peoples a sense of unity, we should begin to standardize what we call ourselves."
