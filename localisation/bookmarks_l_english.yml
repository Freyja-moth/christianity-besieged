 CHR_RUIN:0 "Christianity Besieged"
 CHR_RUIN_DESC:0 "The few remaining Christians states of Europe lie in peril. With Soissony and Lotharginia having lost in recent conflict with the Germans, they have little support left to give to the remaining British Christians city-states. Meanwhile in Iberia, the Liritists, though in a slightly better situation, are still disorganized and beset by powerful Islamic sultanates. Can they survive in Europe, or perhaps in a new world?"
 CHG_GERM:0 "Kingdoms of Germania"
 CHG_GERM_DESC:0 "The Gothic, Saxon, and Thuringen shields have all but been tattered from the German Empire, with Norse and Muslims threatening to push further into the heartland. And despite the breakup of the Islamic empire to the south, they were still successful against the Gothic Emperor and Duke of Gepida, killing the Emperor, ending his rule, and seizing most all his land. The Empire looks to the High King of Zuostenhus and their close allies of the Palatanax to save the Empire."
 MSL_MED:0 "Crescent of the Mediterranean"
 MSL_MED_DESC:0 "The wake of the united Roman Caliphate leaves great opportunities for its inheritors. The Western Mediterranean is all but the playground of Allah's followers, and the era of great expansion and discovery for the Alsababi world has only just begun. What awaits us beyond?"
 AGEOF_NORD:0 "Wars of the North Sea"
 AGEOF_NORD_DESC:0 "Stagnation besets the Scandinavian peninsula after centuries of fragmentation compounded with global cooling, leaving the land unsuitable for its population. To the west, a lucky few Scandinavians found great success in these trying times through conquest and pillage, exploiting to their fullest advantage the divided nature of the Isles, but it has not been since the Hjallaw centuries prior that any similar great men have risen there. To the east, generations of cohabitation with Baltic and Slavic peoples has already encouraged those beyond the Baltic Sea to abandon the Old Gods. As the planet warms again, German princes greedily eye Scandinavian shores while Islamic merchants and pirates become ever more courageous and brazen. To remain divided risks falling wholly to foreign control. Will any heroes rise to face the rising storm?"
 RUSH_RUSSIA:0 "Rise of the Rodhængers"
 RUSH_RUSSIA_DESC:0 "The earliest long-term Norse settlement in the Slavic East was Biksted, who would also be the first here to embrace Jinocenti's traditions, within his lifetime. So in the early 15th century, the rump Pontic Empire, in their bid to retake the Bosphorus, claimed to Rodrija and other Rodoptr states that Biksted was in imminent danger of invasion. This rallied masses of Rodoptr faithful to attack the Bulgar states, the Turkic and Mongol Khans and Baltic tribes independently, ultimately tying Rodrija, Korsariki, Masowsze and other Rodoptr nations into a massive open conflict known as the Achódherjadr, Ostwietjadr, or Great Eastern Holy War. In its wake, Rodhængers, the Norse and Slavic migrants and converts who identify by faith, have carved out a multitude of new independent kingdoms that have greatly upset the balance of power in the region, decimating local populations. Who will rise from the ashes of the chaos?"
 TRIALSOF_MINOR:0 "Trials of Asia Minor"
 TRIALSOF_MINOR_DESC:0 "The Vandal and Tartary invasions of the Balkans left the Greeks pushed out of most all the European half of their ancestral homeland. For centuries, the Pontic Empire maintained an unsteady balance amongst the warring Hellenic Anatolians, but a rising Cappadocia broke it apart centuries before, threatening to engulf the Hellenes in a Mandaean resurgence. Meanwhile, opportunistic powers await on Anatolia's frontiers, threatening to put an end to Greek suzerainty forever."
 THIRD_GENERATION:0 "Rise of the Third Generation"
 THIRD_GENERATION_DESC:0 "The third generation of Kx'ais are rising. After centuries of Q'a Numi kingdoms that maintained tribalistic attitudes and orthodox interpretations of Saa Dzahi's scripture, the third generation of Kx'ais, such as the likes of the Bantu-dominant Sununguko Kx'ai are beginning to form. Elsewhere, groups such as the Jajatsumis and Zed'a Kurudiju!has try to realize similar ambitions, but the Muslims of the coast continue to steal away from the fruits of the Q'a Num. Can you unite the disparate groups of Saa Dzahi's faithful? (NOTE- ! and | symbols are attempted transliterations of some of the 'clicking' consonants featured in the diverse language groups that make up vanilla EU4's Khoisani culture, of which information is dearly lacking, but these are not errors.)"
 DESERTDESERT:0 "Desert the Desert!"
 DESERTDESERT_DESC:0 "Several Saharan tribes dot the vast, desert landscape, capable of exerting great influence and travelling across vast stretches, though this land offers no room for growth and expansion. To do that will require invading landed nations and seizing their territories. Some are lead by castaway dynasties, such as the Marinids and the Balawatids, and Fulo has the choice between uniting an Islamic Great Fulo or leading its people and its pagan traditions north in an attempt to find refuge. Who will emerge from the sands to carve out their grand empires, and who will be cast back into its depths?"
 FETISHISM_BESIEGED:0 "Legacy of the Tutuquv"
 FETISHISM_BESIEGED_DESC:0 "The Tutuquv War, fought between the Kongo and its diplomatic network and a great number of Mudarians against a Q'a Num Kurudi, ultimately saved the Kongo from takeover but has left those of Africa still worshipping their local deities in a precarious position. The once benign Mudarians left the peace table with the lands of Kongoese vassals and vast quantities of slaves, breaking apart the diplomatic network that once made the Kingdom strong. In other parts of Africa, nations like the Grand Ardra, the Jewish community of the Great Lakes, and the Kingdom of Zazzau fight to maintain their traditions in the face of new adversaries."
 BURZAFRAH_CONQUEST:0 "Spah Burzafrah's Grand Conquest"
 BURZAFRAH_CONQUEST_DESC:0 "From a faraway child refugee to a renowned conqueror, Spah Burzafrah's journey has been long indeed. Hired by Geyard to end Latleri raids in 1424, Burzafrah's defense contract escalated to the capture of the Latlerin Catum of Arsa within a year, and Burzafrah would fully subdue the Latleri Sultan by 1427, consequently liberating Faynitia from Ifriqya. He then turned his attention to the Caracalpac, whose rulers were convicted for begetting darkness and corruption, and fully conquered them by 1434, moving his capital to Ortet. The collapse of Armanji to jihad in 1436 saw Burzafrah's swift intervention, destroying the Yaliboylu Emirate in the process. Burzafrah's latest accomplishment has been the repulsion of Grand Morava's coalition in 1440, granting with it even more territory. However, can his new, diverse theocratic nation survive his impending death?"
 BOTRK_TITLE:0 "The Blood of the River Kings"
 BOTRK_DESC:0 "A storm is looming over the great rivers of West Africa. From both the north and south, the Islamic threat loom over the patchwork of religious groups present in the region, causing a burgeoning Q'a Numi presence to rise. Grand Ardra and Oyo make their final stand against one another for supremacy as the threat of Benin looms. The Kingdom of Nri takes its stand to build a coalition of Igbo and other allies to protect from the spread of Islam. The Kororofa Kurudi rapidly grows, stirring upset Islamic nomads on the frontier. Should nobody rise to bring peace amongst the chaos, the rivers could find themselves at the mercy of faraway foreign powers..."
 CB_SONS_SOL:0 "The Last Sons of Sol"
 CB_SONS_SOL_DESC:0 "It has been a century since the Solar Roman Empire came to an end, bringing about a new era of Islamic conversion. But this shift has not reached every corner of the Roman world. On the peripheries, the remaining pagans of Rome gather, filled with disdain for the dismembering of the ancient pantheon. But despite all the force of will concentrated in these small Roman remnant states, can they turn the tide of Islam on the onset of its absolute victory throughout the Empire?"
