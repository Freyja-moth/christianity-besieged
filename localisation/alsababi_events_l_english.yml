 isildaDiyt.1b:0 "Okay, time to put an end to this."

Seeking a fair trial to her reforms, she quickly weaves the tale of how she seemingly threatened her rulers' fragile self esteem by showing, as a woman, her prowess in debate, proving the worth of herself and her values. Having been unlawfully denied the opportunity to test the validity of her reforms in Ferrara, she beseeches the Caliph for the opportunity to speak out to the learned theologians of the highest court of God."

Seeking a fair trial to her reforms, she quickly weaves the tale of how she was unlawfully expelled from her home the moment she began to talk of change. Claiming this reactionary actions to be antithetical to the very nature of the faith, she beseeches the Caliph for the opportunity to speak out to the learned theologians of the highest court of God."

 isildaDiyt.3d:0 "Word has spread to the Bayt Allah of the interesting reforms that have taken place in the city state of Ferrara. Spearheaded by the efforts of one of the most influential modern thinkers of northern Italya, Isilda Nojua, women have begun to take places in important government roles, and even rumors spread that their presence has even spread into the military. According to delegations from the city, the entire process was legal and her reforms hold great merit for the potential future of all holy women."

 isildaDiyt.4t:0 "The Diyt of Isilda Nojua"
 isildaDiyt.4d:0 "The Caliph has called the faithful to a Diyt regarding the reforms proposed by Isilda Nojua, which would bring sweeping gender equity. Isilda believes that the status quo is antithetical to the word of God, who told Muhammad of the importance of spiritual equality and the opportunity for all individuals to seek education, and to use their education in betterment of the faith. The possible strength to gain for the entire Caliphate, she says, it too much to bear. The opposition, however, additionally has many Quranic sources that clearly indicate the specific complimentary roles of women in society, and a single husband to many wives is a clear indicator of this. But Isilda retorts, believing the decision comes from weighing the potential biases of Muhammad, the prophet, against those of the Arabic society in which he was born into, many of whom repeatedly attempted to curb his efforts to spread the faith. The debate is heated, though her staunchest opponents seemingly struggle staying level-headed, the paradox of their respect for gender roles preventing them from trying to intimidate her in front of the Caliph."

 isildaDiyt.6t:0 "Isilda is Victorious"
 isildaDiyt.6d:0 "The votes are in, and it is settled - the faith's greatest thinkers are behind Isilda. Clearly, the political circumstances of Muhammad's rise to power forced him to make concessions towards the truth in order to convince his fellow neighbors to begin to take the holy path forward. And through diplomacy, faith, conquest, and the pursuit of knowledge, we have purified God's holy designs from their worldly coils. Women have been wrongly closed from greater pursuits, and to continue to close them would be to knowingly defer from His designs."
 isildaDiyt.6a:0 "What an interesting development."

 isildaDiyt.6e:0 "How did this happen..?"
 isildaDiyt.7t:0 "Isilda is Defeated"
 isildaDiyt.7d:0 "The votes are in, and it is settled - these reforms have no place in the Ashab Alsabab. It is without question that influential women such as Khadijah and Fatimah have made the faith what it is today - but their role was, and always will be, a complimentary role to the one that men have today. This status quo has brought great success to the faith, and nearly every other sect and school of jurisprudence agrees with it. Isilda's reforms have no place in a Godly society."
 isildaDiyt.7a:0 "A fairly predictable outcome."
 isildaDiyt.7b:0 "Finally, she's gone!"
 isildaDiyt.8d:0 "A fascinating woman has arrived in Venetia, a living pariah of the Alsababi world.
