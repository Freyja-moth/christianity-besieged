 cultureshift.1t:0  "Syrian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.1d:0 "With the Muslim conquest of Syria, the Aramaic population has adopted Islam, hegemonizing with Arabic traditions. Now, the Aramaic culture has become Syrian."
 cultureshift.1a:0 "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.2t:0 "Italyan Culture Develops"
 cultureshift.2d:0 "Since the conquest of the Roman Empire and the raising of the Turkic Caliph of Rum, the Turkic and Roman peoples of Italya have brought way to a new, united Italyan identity through the introduction of Islam, something new to the Turks and Romans that brought them together. While originally Turks were often separate from the Romans, often perceived as a foreign, invasive ruling class that could barely speak Latin, but the spread of the Fus'ha as a religious language has heavily influenced the regional dialects of the peninsula, easing communication between the diverse groups and naturally shifting out the Latin alphabet which separated them."
 cultureshift.2a:0 "A new culture spreads."
 cultureshift.3t:0 "The Turkig Identity"
 cultureshift.3d:0 "Many Turkic peoples, especially those of smaller and isolated cultural groups who found themselves surrounded by aggressive foreign powers, were quickly subsumed within the rapidly spreading cultural sphere around the rise of Manichaeism in the region. Manichaeist bishops flooded the Balkans, creating militarized religious followings that would serve not only to settle many of the remaining nomadic Turkic peoples but also create a cultural renaissance where many Turkic and Persian but also Anatolian, Caucasian, Hellenic, and Vandalic cultural ideas would synthesize. Many Turks have taken on the identity of Turkig, or the Turks Worthy of Paradise, a title oft given by Iranian bishops to any Turkic converts."
 cultureshift.3a:0 "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.4t:0 "Balkanli Culture Develops"
 cultureshift.4d:0 "Under Rumi dominance, a growing number of Latlerin and Qashqai Turks across the Adriatic are beginning to identify as Balkanli, distinguished by fluency in Fus'ha alongside a regional Arabic dialect more heavily influenced by the Arabs than Italyan Arabic, and thusly they hold a greater cultural connection to the Mediterranean world than they ever have before."
 cultureshift.4a:0 "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.5t:0 "Juthudi Culture Spreads"
 cultureshift.5d:0 "As more and more Gothic and Gaulish peoples shed their Germanic identities, learn Fus'ha, and join the theological communities of the Mediterranean, more are identitying as Juthudi."
 cultureshift.5a:0 "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.6t:0 "Gothic Culture Returns"
 cultureshift.6d:0 "As the authority of Wodan's faithful return to the Islamic Goths, old Germanic traditions have been returned, though most of these cultures values and traditions are adapted from those of the ruling Gothic class that has come into control of Juthudi land, as opposed to whatever geographic Germanic dialects were held before their initial Islamic conversion."
 cultureshift.7t:0 "Emergence of the Andebereans"
 cultureshift.7d:0 "With the rise of Christianity throughout the Iberian peninsula, a new era has emerged for the diverse peoples who have inhabited the continent. The Arabized-Berber/Roman populations that once were united under Islam have now been more deeply connected to the Celtiberian cultural sphere, but now under the grace of Christ."
 cultureshift.7a:0 "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.8t:0 "Spread of Aybirean Culture"
 cultureshift.8d:0 "Since joining the Islamic cultural sphere in the Mediterranean, the Celtiberian identity that was once held here has been sidelined as the Celtiberians learn Fus'ha and the regional Arabic dialect, finding greater opportunities being connected to the burgeoning Mediterranean world than grasping onto tribal identity."
 cultureshift.8a:0 "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.9t:0 "Palestinian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.9d:0 "With the Muslim conquest of Judea, many Hebrews have adopted Islam and many others have fled to find new homes elsewhere. As many Arabs come to fill the vacant homes left behind, they mingle with the Islamic Hebrews to nurture a new Palestinian culture."
 cultureshift.9a:0 "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.10t:0 "Egyptian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.10d:0 "Since the end of the second Kingdom of Beta Yis'rael, many Hebrews have adopted Islam and many others have fled to find new homes elsewhere. As many Egyptian Arabs come to fill the vacant homes left behind, they bring the Egyptian identity with them."
 cultureshift.10a:0 "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.11t:0 "Jeberti Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.11d:0 "Since the rise of Islam in the region, and the loss of Jewish autonomy, Hebrews have vacated their homes en masse, with most of the remnants conversion to Islam, leaving the Jeberti culture dominant in the region."
 cultureshift.11a:0 "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.12t:0 "Mashriqi Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.12d:0 "With the rise of Islam in Mesopotamia, the ancient Assyrian identity is falling to the wayside of the greater Arabic cultural sphere. Learning Arabic for Fush'a and transliterating the Aramaic alphabets in favor of the Arabic script, it's hard to consider these peoples Assyrian anymore."
 cultureshift.12a:0 "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.13t:0 "Rise of the Almani"
 cultureshift.13d:0 "The spread of Islam throughout Germanic land has completely changed their cultures. Once separate tribal identities are now identifying as Almani, an Arabization of the Germanic 'All-Men', united by an understanding of Fus'ha that ties them together and contrasts them to their other Germanic cousins."
 cultureshift.13a:0 "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.14t:0 "Tarkhagan Identity Fading"
 cultureshift.14d:0 "Since the downfall of the Tarkhaganate, the Tarkhagan nobility that once ruled all Tartars has blended itself seamlessly into Cumanac society. Many have become mercenaries, more have started mercantile ventures within and outside the nation, and most of the rest have fallen into place throughout different parts of the nation."
 cultureshift.14a:0 "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.15t:0 "Rise of the Trakyali"
 cultureshift.15d:0 "Since our jihad and conversion of the region to worship of Allah, the local Tartary peoples have begun to be known as Trakyali. Affluent members are already rising through religious society, speaking perfect Fus'ha in mosques throughout the nation and gaining closer ties to the rest of the affluent Mediterranean."
 cultureshift.15a:0 "Masha'allah."
 cultureshift.16t:0 "Rise of the Avandaloi"
 cultureshift.16d:0 "Since our conversions of Andalucian territory many generations ago, their peoples have been born to love and envy the greatness that is Hellenic culture. The term Andalucian is an old and foreign one- these Hellenic peoples are known as the Avandaloi, and they seek to be a part of our great legacy."
 cultureshift.16a:0 "Who wouldn't want to be Hellenic?"
 cultureshift.17t:0 "Rearabization in [Root.GetName]"
 cultureshift.17d:0 "After centuries of heavy influence from Eranshahr preventing the Arabs of North Arabia from converting to the true faith and reconnecting with their southern bretheren, our liberation seems to have finally brought about the rise of new Islamic Arab culture in the region."
 cultureshift.17a:0 "How excellent!"
 cultureshift.18t:0 "Latlerin Tradition Spreading"
 cultureshift.18d:0 "The widespread implementation of Roman traditions in the local Turkish populace has encouraged them to begin to adopt the cultural practices of their Latinized cousins, thusly spreading the Latlerin cultural tradition deeper into Illyria."
 cultureshift.19t:0 "Spread of the Kurds"
 cultureshift.19d:0 "It seems the uniting force of Islam has brought many old communities of [Root.GetName] together with the nearby Kurds. These new peoples show a cultural unity unlike anything seen in the region in a long time."
 cultureshift.19a:0 "Incredible."
 cultureshift.20t:0 "Unity of the Iranians"
 cultureshift.20d:0 "In the wake of the spread of Islam and the Arabization of the region, the prideful Iranian people have seemingly grown together. As the Pahlavi language falls out of favor and is replaced with a text more alike to modern Farsi, the differences between regional dialects thin out, and communication and the spread of information grows between the Iranian communities."
