 venetianEvents.1t:0 "The Question of Mithraism"
 venetianEvents.1da:0 "For centuries, scholar and visionaries have studies the similarities between the solar worshippers of the empires of Rome and Iran. It wasn't until now that we finally began to understand the truth behind the heavenly gift bestowed upon our collective peoples - Sol and Mithra, the same deity, blessed all our peoples in order to bring humanity to enlightenment. Is this not the goal we all strive for?"
 venetianEvents.1db:0 "For millenia, the tyrants of Iran have tried everything they can to lead the world to believe their Emperors are divine, to the point of trying to infiltrate Sol worship within Rome. Sol is the God of the Sun, and gives his divine blessing to Rome alone."

 venetianEvents.3d:0 "In [Root.GetName] we are nearly completed with a fabulous temple dedicated to the Gods.

 venetianEvents.4d:0 "In [Root.GetName], we have constructed a glorious monument to our conquest, a fortress of great flexibility.

 venetianEvents.6t:0 "The Privilegiis Venetia"
 venetianEvents.6d:0 "As we regain control of Rome and reassert ourselves, we come back to the treatise we had set in our state that gave grand privileges to Venetia. While this has allowed us to have far-reaching authority in the affairs of the country, it's now a weapon pointed against us. The Venetians are clamoring for either their promised autonomy, or their place at the center of the empire. How should we proceed with this moving forward?"
 venetianEvents.6a:0 "Respect the Privilegiis Venetia."
 venetianEvents.6b:0 "Then the center of Rome shall be Venetia!"
 venetianEvents.6c:0 "We have moved past the need to hide away. Now submit!"
