 church_of_cambridge:0 "Legacy of the Resistance"
 church_of_cambridge_desc:0 "The Ut Dimissi can find its origins in the Norse Hjallaw, which started in 1028 when the military dictatorship of Vitalianus, which brought widespread corruption to Brittania, found itself laughably incapable of preventing the Hjallish King from taking over the region - sacking Londonium to little resistance. Most Roman communities (especially in central and northern Brittania) were absolutely decimated as the Hjallaw attracted the settlement of thousands of Norse communities who conquered and displaced the Britons. But a heroic band of freemen, our ancestors, protected the Roman communities in the region around Durolipons, frequently raiding Londonium and making the entire region unviable for Norse settlement while bringing in refugees who overwhelmingly saw this a miracle of God and converted to the true faith. Without their sacrifices, the Christians of Brittania would have been forced asunder."
 order_of_god:0 "Liberators of Londinium"
 order_of_god_desc:0 "In 1055, the army of the Christian freemen, known at the time as the Dimissi Praesidium Roma Miraculum, or Protectors of the Forgiven Miracle in Rome, liberated Londinium and brought it under the rule of the Societas Piorum. The liberation was done in reaction to the landing of Artour, a claimant who had fled the island as a toddler and whose family and person would be forgiven in Londinium upon his return. While many claim that Artour never officially renounced the Roman faiths, and still paid tribute to Jupiter, the Emperors and Sol Invictus, the Societas Piorum was never completely absolished and Christianity flourished under Roman rule for the first time in history, leaving most to accept that Artor accepted Jesus personally and laid the ground for the true faith to flourish in Brittania and Soissons."
 holy_missionaries:0 "Legitimacy of the Societas Piorum"
 holy_missionaries_desc:0 "Beginning as a small council of theologically astude veterans of the Christian society within the Hjallaw, the Societas Piorum briefly ruled as the governing body of Londinium before submerging into the background as a tolerated though rapidly growing representative body that legitimized Christian worship under the Roman system under Artour. The Piorum held the loyalty of the Dimissi, whose veterancy and expertise in local warfare was vital to Artor's reconquest efforts against the petty Norse kings that were consolidating power in the wake of the Hjallaw.\n Despite the failures that occured in the rule of the kings immediately before and after Artor, the Piorum would survive the reign of Artor's successor (believed by the Societas to be Constantine IV). The Piorum also helped provide financial aid to emergent Christian groups in Soissons during the reign of Riothamus, who united the entire region after the reign of Constantine IV and the death of Vitalianus, who had fled to the Soissons and remained in power."

The wars saw the balance of power shift away from the ancient suzerainty of the Pontic Empire as the Cappadocian Kingdom conquered most of its territory in the west while building strong allies out of its vassals in the east. In the 14th century, the Cappadocian king encouraged the diplomatic union of the dynasties of Dorylaion and Synnada, Phrygian rump states left behind from the Phrygian War nearly half a millenia prior, invoking imagery of the ancient Spartans and inspiring an irredentist, anti-Pontic attitude.

 legacy_of_the_two_xiphares_desc:0 "The power struggle between Xiphares the Young and Xiphares the Old, the two claimants to the throne during the Pontic Civil War of 2 BC-5 AD, sowed ancient seeds of rivalry and competition amongst our vassals, whose lands were transferred based on whether they were loyal or not to Xiphares the Old and his outrageous land promises that were mostly kept. Phyrgia and Pamphylia, who remained loyal to the Young until the end, would lose almost half their lands, creating deep-seeded hatred that would manifest in the Phrygian War a few centuries later. Cappadocia, once a very minor player in Pontic politics, would become massively influential over the centuries, especially with its conquest of Armenian territory later on. We must never let drawn-out, disasterous conflicts and poor diplomatic decisions result in long periods of military stagnation and decline, and our armies must always be ready to defend our borders."

But his son Batu had a new vision for some of the lands he helped conquer. He invisioned a vast, grand city, one built for the settlement and enrichment of his peoples, one that would become the crown jewel of the Mediterranean. Allured not by the beauty of the well-defendable Balkans to build his mountain-fortress, Batu Khan would found the center of his dynasty on the ruins of an insignificant Hellenic coastal town facing across from the Hellenic port-city of Chalcedon, setting the foundations for the modern fortress-city of Balik."

However, as Metradis came of age, he grew to despise the ruling dynasty of Ukuk and the nomadic Khans, ultimately leading a successful revolt against them a mere 3 years upon his rise to power, becoming the third Khan to rule from Balik when the peace was drawn in 1269. More importantly, however, he was the first truly Balikaac Khan, a multilingual Balikaac who enjoyed a great decree of learning in literature and the arts.

Scholars of this new Andalucian culture grew interested in the development of the local culture and heritage, encouraged by their fascination with the language, a Semitic (Arabic) language with Indian influences written in a vulgar Latin alphabet, incorporating Arabic and Indian sounds with accents, along with the Greek Epsilon for the letter 'Ayn (portrayed in-game as á). Arabs and Berbers would call these peoples and their language the "Arabized Indians of Rome", which would ultimately evolve into the local endonym of Abindári.

The main way we Assyrians fight back against such things is via the reintroduction of an ancient military tactic, the system of Spear, Shield and Bow. Through this system all archers, who otherwise would be vulnerable are protected by men of spear and shield.

Having slowly expanded through the diplomatic network of northern India, the Sasanian court ultimately would move from Ctesiphon to Thatta, further cementing the infrastructure of the state southwards. However, the open steppes north of the Indus valley were an easy target for the conquests of the Mongol invaders, who would inherit the eastern portion of the Sasanian empire./n As for the west, the vacuum left by their Sasanian overlords gave the powerful Armenian satrap an opportunity to support a more cooperate dynasty of the neighboring Median nobility.

Beset by conquerors on both sides, hungry to secure their legacies, Armenia was carved up between the Roman and Sassanian empires. Erato's great-uncle, K'sifares I, ruled Armenia while her father ruled the Upper Levant under Roman agreement. Deeply unpopular, K'sifares would face his end upon the arrival of the Pontic King, Mithridates VII, who had been called to Tigranocerta by K'sifares himself, and decided to execute him at the behest of the cityfolk and noblemen. But Mithridates left his Pontic son on the Armenian throne - propelling Erato's father into an attempted conquest of Armenia, an adventure that would bring the demise of Erato's father and brother. As the last living noble of Artashesean blood, Erato would undermine the Romans to bring union between herself and Phraates I, the Iranian prince that lay claim to Armenia. This new Iranian-Armenian dynasty brought unity amongst the Armenians and support from the Iranians, allowing the swift expulsion of the Pontic pretender - and this would secure what has been to this day an everlasting peace between Hayastan and the Shahanshah. To this day, Queen Erato is fondly remembered as the mother of all modern Armenian kings, and a figure of the nation itself."

As we secured the eternal safety of Iran's western border, it continued to look further and further east, its capital even moving faraway to Thatta, at what at the time was the center of the Iranian empire. But when the Mongol Empire encroached upon Iran, with its northerly vassals having become turncoats, its new center was laid to waste. Our nation moved quickly to secure the safety of our mission - humanity's mission - to triumph against the darkness within us and around us, by protecting the holiest of places on the mortal plane within the west of the Iranian empire - the holy fires. Given our history of cooperation, it was with little tension that we were able to work with the Median nobility in securing their future, understandably given the horror stories coming from Thatta.
