 cams_slavic_flavor_name:0 "Missionaries in Moravia"
 cams_slavic_flavor_desc:0 "We've been noticing that, as of late, there have been a noteable increase of missionaries in the country. These missionaries pay for their hospitality, and those that don't feed off the lowborn or are delinquients that make their money back on the slave market. Beyond the economic benefits, however, are the obvious issues that come with the possibility of the division they could bring."
 cams_slavic_flavor.1a:0 "They can stay, at least for now..."
 cams_slavic_flavor.1b:0 "Well that won't do."
 cams_slavic_flavor_2_name:0 "Missionaries Rising"
 cams_slavic_flavor_2_desc:0 "It's come to our attention that the quantity of foreign missionaries have been rising a lot more steadily. Greek thinkers have been passing through more often, and seem to enjoy our leniency to their presence. The Roman Mission has even established a permenant presence at a mosque in close proximity to Sunni-dominant land. Should we step in?"
 cams_slavic_flavor_2a:0 "I kind of like them... and their money."
 cams_slavic_flavor_2b:0 "The others are fine, but I won't tolerate the Roman mission."
 cams_slavic_flavor_2c:0 "Well, they've had their fun."
 cams_slavic_flavor.3_name:0 "Chaos in [Root.GetName]"
 cams_slavic_flavor.3_desc:0 "It seems that a particularly influential Germanic priest has been causing a bit of a stir in [Root.GetName] lately. The city seems near split in two at this point, and on every street corner the squabbling is escalating into violence. What should we do?"
 cams_slavic_flavor.3a:0 "Seems they're sorting things in a timely manner!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.3b:0 "Looks like we have to inform them who the right gods are."
 cams_slavic_flavor.3c:0 "Hunt down this priest and put an end to these missionaries!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.4_name:0 "Roman Mission succeeds"
 cams_slavic_flavor.4_desc:0 "It seems that the tireless efforts of the Roman Mission have actually managed to bear some fruit. They actually, somehow, have converted the majority of [Root.GetName] to the Sunni faith..."
 cams_slavic_flavor.4a:0 "Worrisome..."
 cams_slavic_flavor.4b:0 "Okay, time to put an end to these missionaries."
 cams_slavic_flavor.5_name:0 "Hellenic Speaker Inspires Province"
 cams_slavic_flavor.5_desc:0 "We received word that after a long and tiresome debate between a village elder in [Root.GetName] and a Hellenic thinker from Phyrgia, that the Elder was so inspired that he has hailed the thinker a demi god created to save Great Moravia. They've converted nearly everyone in [Root.GetName] in a mere month!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.5b:0 "Alright, banish the thinker and all his kind. It's time to end the missionaries."
 cams_slavic_flavor.6_name:0 "The Great Moravian Faith Race"
 cams_slavic_flavor.6_desc:0 "It seems that the foreign god worshippers that we have granted hospitality to have taken our friendly attitude seriously to heart. Calls to win the debate of faith that they perceive to be happening is causing devout of all kinds to flood our country, and we're becoming more contested than Jerusalem. They're seriously starting to have a major impact on our people, but they're also seriously starting to have a major impact on our treasury too, for the better."
 cams_slavic_flavor.6a:0 "It's time to make a decision of our faith."
 cams_slavic_flavor.6b:0 "If only we could keep this scheme going forever!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.6c:0 "It's time to drive the missionaries out."
 cams_slavic_flavor.7_name:0 "The Finest Missionaries"
 cams_slavic_flavor.7_desc:0 "We have decided, given the state of our nation, to give out the call for the finest missionaries from the respective faiths that have invested so much into our country. They are all expected to arrive within the month, and we await them eagerly."
 cams_slavic_flavor.7a:0 "We will wait for them."
 CAMS_SLAVIC_FLAVOR_7_TOOLTIP:0 "Who will arrive first..?"
 cams_slavic_flavor.8_name:0 "Dicaeus Polyphontes"
 cams_slavic_flavor.8_desc:0 "Early in the morning, the Hellenic missionary arrives. His name is Dicaeus Polyphontes, and he received our call for enlightenment while debating our people throughout Moravia and was quick to heed it. \"Our faiths are kin,\" he says, \"though the world of the Greeks and our gods will open your nation to a whole new era of possibilities. It gives you access to a powerful network of ancient city-states and our rich culture.\" Though we had explained we would wait on the other missionaries before making our decision, the missionary presented to us a pouch of rare pearls and gemstones unique to Anatolian mines, ours to keep should we swear to Olympus."
 cams_slavic_flavor.8a:0 "Wait, there's money involved? I'm in."
 cams_slavic_flavor.8b:0 "No bribery, the others deserve a voice."
 CAMS_SLAVIC_FLAVOR_8_TOOLTIP:0 "Who will arrive next?"
 CAMS_SLAVIC_FLAVOR_9_TOOLTIP:0 "Now to wait for the German..."
 cams_slavic_flavor.9_name:0 "Bozdogan Halefoniu"
 cams_slavic_flavor.9_desc:0 "It doesn't take much longer than a week for the next missionary to arrive, the dark skinned big-moustache wielding Grand Mufti of Rome, apparently one of their highest titles. With his two envoys included, he definitely plays the role well. He had received our call for enlightenment while out for judgement in a fishing village off the Adriatic, and rode to Gorz hastily before finishing his journey on foot. He says as the official hand of Sunni law, he speaks with the voice of God, and God has demanded that his holy children save Great Moravia from the inevitable destruction that our willfull suspension of disbelief would bring. Apparently, God also offers a chest filled with ancient Roman gold coins and some fine Turkish pottery to go with it as well, should we swear fealty to him now."
 cams_slavic_flavor.9a:0 "I think we've surpassed the \"no bribe\" threshold."
 cams_slavic_flavor.9b:0 "No, the Germanic priest hasn't arrived yet."
 cams_slavic_flavor.10_name:0 "Wittigis of Faas"
 cams_slavic_flavor.10_desc:0 "Tomorrow you were going to decide between Dicaeus and Bozdogan, but then late into the day a man in rags came to the castle, claiming to be Wittigis of Faas, the most influential lowborn voice of the German Empire. Why surely looking lowborn, he definitely did not look influential. However, he claims during his passage through the Alps, he had been captured by dreadful Christian bandits, who stripped him of his gifts, including a fine Visigothic bust, and his holy garb. Regardless, he kept his voice and legs, and marched onward. In his argument to us, he claims that despite the similarities between Germanic, Hellenic, and Slavic faiths, having the addition of the German Empire's friendship and the same grace of God that gave the Germans the ability to spread across Europe would be a much finer boon than any other religion would offer, even Sunni, a religion 'just as sickly as Christianity'. And despite his gifts being stolen, he offers to give his life to servicing the faith in Great Moravia at no expense to us should we accept the offer today. Regardless, he expects to stay the week to hear out our decision and make himself available for employment to a Germanic Moravia."
 cams_slavic_flavor.10a:0 "Well, it's not like there's anyone else to hear out..."
 cams_slavic_flavor.10b:0 "We're still going to need the week to decide, Wittigis."
 CAMS_SLAVIC_FLAVOR_10_TOOLTIP:0 "We shall weigh the testimonies over the week."
 cams_slavic_flavor.11_desc:0 "The time has come to make our decision known to the world. Wittigas of Faas is the only of the three missionaries who remain, but dignitaries from several Hellenic and Sunni nations have come to hear the decision as well. What is the will of Great Moravia, she who has stood for eight hundred years?"
 cams_slavic_flavor.11_name:0 "The Day of Decision"
 cams_slavic_flavor.11a:0 "Great Moravia pledges herself to Olympus!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.11b:0 "Great Moravia pledges herself to Allah!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.11c:0 "Great Moravia pledges herself to Wodan!"
 cams_slavic_flavor.11d:0 "Great Moravia will not shake her ancient foundations!"

 slavicreplacement.EVTNAME0: "Return of the Croats"
 slavicreplacement.EVTDESC0: "The ancestral homeland of the Croats, conquered by the Turkhanate in the early 14th century, has come under our domain. Our subjects are pleading to be able to return to their ancestral family homes, but should we expel the new owners?"
 slavicreplacement0.EVTOPT1: "Enforce their resettlement."
 slavicreplacement0.EVTOPT2: "Our new subjects deserve respect."
 slavicreplacement.EVTNAME1: "Fears of Local Collapse"
 slavicreplacement.EVTDESC1: "Our effort to evict the Turks of old Croatia is proving to require a greater investment of resources than we initially expected. The local Turkish peasants are putting up quite the fight to keep their homes, resulting in an unexpected amount of casualties amongst them and the Croats. The soldiers tasked to the effort that have survived thus far fall under progressively greater risk of being overwhelmed. How dramatic of a response should we make?"
 slavicreplacement1.EVTOPT1: "It's our army's greatest priority to smooth this process."
 slavicreplacement1.EVTOPT2: "Bolster the local garrisons to help the eviction parties."
 slavicreplacement1.EVTOPT3: "The local garrisons should be able to clear a little rabble."
 heavysiege.EVTNAME1: "Chaos!"
 heavysiege.EVTDESC1: "Our efforts to resettle the Croatian population have caused grave loss and bloodshed. With local garrisons mostly depleted from the conflict, the majority of the effort of resettlement has fallen to the Croats themselves, who fight village to village, city to city."
 heavysiege.EVTOPT1: "Oh Perun, why have you deprieved us of your blessing?"
 mildsiege.EVTNAME1: "Balkan Troubles"
 mildsiege.EVTDESC1: "The forces we have sent for our resettlement operations have managed to continue moving the process along, though in many places progress has slowed and stalled as our army simply hasn't the manpower to keep things running smoothly. For now, the ancient Croatian homeland is in a mixed state of lawlessness and chaos as the operation trudges forward."
 mildsiege.EVTOPT1: "We're just going to have to persevere."
 lightsiege.EVTNAME1: "The Bumpy Road of Relocation"
 lightsiege.EVTDESC1: "The additional forces we have sent for our resettlement process have proven key in mitigating the damages caused by this operation. Despite these efforts, however, the chaos of mass-evicting the Turks is still leading to major losses, though this was likely inevitable."
 lightsiege.EVTOPT1: "We can weather this storm."
 liftedsiege.EVTNAME1: "All According to Plan"
 liftedsiege.EVTDESC1: "Having focused our military efforts on the relocation procedures, things seem to be running about as smoothly as can be expected. Our garrisons mostly have the manpower to run their operations, and are helping each other accordingly. Damage from conflict of people who don't wish to be evicted, however, is likely an inevitable consequence."
 liftedsiege.EVTOPT1: "Given the circumstances, well done!"
 Assassination.EVTNAME0: "Rumors of Conspiracy"
 Assassination.EVTDESC0: "The recent chaos that shook our nation has had a major impact on the status of Turkish people within our borders, leading them to be widely mistrusted. There have been ongoing rumors of conspiracy of a Turkish-lead assasination circulating around our realm, how should we react to this?"
 Assassination.EVTOPT1: "Baseless rabble, keep the regular bodyguards."
 Assassination.EVTOPT2: "We ought to tighten things a bit."
 Assassination.EVTOPT3: "Relocate the military divisions to work on the security of the car."
 Assassination.EVTOPT4: "Complete lockdown of the capital, and have the military search the capital."
 Assassination.EVTNAME1: "The Car Struck By Conspirators!"
 Assassination.EVTDESC1: "The Car has been struck with a knife blow to the chest, the conspirators were eventually caught, and will be dealt with eventually, for the moment it is uncertain if the car will die, but the outcomes don't look very good..."
 Assassination.EVTOPT5: "Let us pray for our mighty Car."
 Assassination.EVTNAME2: "The Conspirators Arrested"
 Assassination.EVTDESC2: "The Conspirators were found in the Car's home village in the capital city of our realm, during their schemeing our military divisions caught wind of their malicous intents, and were arrested."
 Assassination.EVTOPT6: "Nobody escapes the Car!"
 Assassination.EVTNAME3: "The Conspirators Fail"
 Assassination.EVTDESC3: "The Conspirators attempt to murder the Car was a complete disaster, they attempted to sneak past security and strike the car with a knife to the chest, but alas the extra security extracted from military division, proved useful in their capture, before the act was commited."
 Assassination.EVTOPT7: "Hail Perun for the Car lives!"
 slavicreplacementend.EVTNAME0: "Returned to the Homeland"
 slavicreplacementend.EVTDESC0: "We have driven the Turk from the Croatian homeland. Croatian families are settling well into their ancestral homes, rediscovering treasures of their past, all thanks to the power of our ancient Empire."
 slavicreplacementend.EVTOPT0: "Perun be praised!"
