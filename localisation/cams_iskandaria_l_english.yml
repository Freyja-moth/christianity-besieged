 iskandaria.t:0 "Families of Janub Ifriqya"
 iskandaria.d:0 "We have been surveying and documenting our new territories in Janub Ifriqya, in search of prominent families that can best represent the voices of the people. We had originally settled between the Abbasid-era Muhallabids and the Haladri-era Hafsids - both families have long histories of rulership in the land. However, we were approached by the Aglidanab family, wealthy date-growing enterprisers who cornered most of the fertile land of Annaba, and they have provided us a great tribute - promising to become great philantropists to the Iskandarian Council should they have a personal vested interest in it."
 iskandaria.a:0 "The wealthy Aglidanab have shown their contemporary power, and best represent the voice of the modern Janub Ifriqyans."
 iskandaria.b:0 "The Muhallabids were faithful rulers underneath the Abbasids, and should be returned to their station."
 iskandaria.c:0 "The Hafsids served as the peoples voice during the Haladri era, and should serve as their people's voice now."
 iskandaria.1t:0 "A Growing Desire for the Holy Land"
 iskandaria.1d:0 "Throughout the common folk and the nobility alike, a fire seems to have begun to blaze throughout our people. Having liberated the people of Gaza, our people are clamoring for more. The threat of Yehudah can be defeated, they say, and new doors opened to spread the faith should their kingdom be conquered."
 iskandaria.1a:0 "We will protect the Holy Land."
 iskandaria.1b:0 "We should treat our fellow 'Ahl al-Kitab with respect."
 iskandaria.2t:0 "The Prominent Families of Medina"
 iskandaria.2d:0 "The city of Medina, finally safely under the control of our nation, is finally free to represent itself in our rapidly growing nation. Any law-abiding Shafi'i understands the importance of the people of Medina, and we must make a difficult choice - should we allow the previous Sharifs of Medina to resume their rule, understanding their competence - or should we allow anybody worthy from this most holy of cities the opportunity to represent?"
 iskandaria.2a:0 "Restore the Husaynids."
 alex_husaynids_tt:0 "The Husaynids are renowned for their incredible administrative work in Medina, and have ruled the city peacefully throughout many Caliphates."
 iskandaria.2b:0 "Make all theologically astude Medinans eligible."
 alex_allmedina_tt:0 "This will bring us a great diversity of candidates, from potential prodigies to lemons."
 iskandaria.3t:0 "A New Family Rises in Tripoli"
 iskandaria.3d:0 "In Tripoli, one family in particular has steadily been gaining prominence within our new government - the Amatids. Rising to great influence in the region in no small part due to the family's rich ties to the military conquests of the Haladri Caliphate of old, our Almukhidi subjects look to the Amatids to represent their voice in the greater political system we have nourished.\nAs our nation has expanded, the minor nobles of Iskandaria proper have fought to maintain their influence across our rapidly growing estate, and in this climb to power, the [Root.AlexSurvivedFamily] have left both the [Root.AlexFallenFamilies] to fall to obscurity."
 iskandaria.3a:0 "An interesting development."
 iskandaria.4t:0 "Power Shift in Iskandaria"
 iskandaria.4d:0 "It seems that in Tripoli, the [Root.AlexSurvivedFamily] have restored their relevance in the political machine, owing their favorable position to the conquest and their contributions to re-establishing our cultural ties. As our nation has expanded, the minor nobles of Iskandaria proper have fought to maintain their influence across our rapidly growing estate, leaving the [Root.AlexFallenFamilies] to fall to obscurity."
 iskandaria.5t:0 "The Christians of Seliah"
 iskandaria.5d:0 "Seliah is a massive temple-estate, having been mostly unimpeded from proliferation by its friendly heathen neighbors. The worshippers are followers of Christ, a minority faith that seemingly never got the memo about Muhammad. But their faith, regardless, is fascinating, and technically these followers of Christ are People of the Book. Though their divine revelation is archaic, maybe we should respect it all the same."
 iskandaria.5a:0 "Guarantee the autonomy of the church."
 iskandaria.5b:0 "Provide the church with limited autonomy."
 iskandaria.5c:0 "Time to remind them about the last prophet."
 iskandaria.6t:0 "Dealing with Heresy"
 iskandaria.6d:0 "As we continue to bear a greater responsibility in the administration and management of the Islamic community as a whole, we must make the decision of how best we are to approach those faithful who perceive a different line of succession to us. Should the followers of Ali, as tyrannical and extreme as their Caliphs have been in the past, be given the right to express their opinions and continue proselyzing? Or should we attempt to stamp out these concepts for good, and see to right the wrongs of all of Muhammad's astray followers?"
 iskandaria.6a:0 "Allow other Islamic thinkers their due representation."
 iskandaria.6b:0 "Tighten on the crackdown against these heretical thinkers."

 iskandaria.7g:0 "Appoint a representative from Medina."
 iskandaria.7h:0 "Appoint a Husaynid from Medina."
 iskandaria.8t:0 "The Council of Iskandaria"
 iskandaria.8d:0 "The death of the heirless Emir Ghaen, the last of the Ibidis branch of the Egyptian Samarids, has left us without any eligible Emirs with dynastic ties to the Haladri Caliphate of old. Worse still, his death comes at a time of great judicial reform, as late 1444 is the first time in our short two year history that we have not been in war. Azmy al-Munaqadhin decries any effort to transition from the Faridri jurisprudence of our predecessors, Youssif Elsherif argues Shafi'i jurisprudence brings us closer to the majority of the Sunni world, and Muhammad ibn Tumaini al-Sa'idi claims this moment as an opportunity to tie ourselves to the holy city of Medina through the Maliki school."
 iskandaria.8a:0 "Embrace Azmy and the Faridri tradition of the Abbasids and Haladris."
 iskandaria.8b:0 "Embrace the Shafi'i tradition of the Mamluks and the Berber Sultanates."
 iskandaria.8c:0 "Embrace the Maliki tradition of Medina and the rest of Sunni Arabia."
