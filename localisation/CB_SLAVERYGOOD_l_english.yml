 SLAVERYGOOD.0c: "This all sounds very complex...."

 SLAVERYGOOD.1t: "Rise of a Naghali Population Hub"
 SLAVERYGOOD.1d: "Thanks to our policy of lenient manumission towards the Naghali, many of them have been settling around the market of [Root.GetName], oftentimes purchasing other Naghali and immediately manumitting them. This has resulted in the rapid rise of a large community in the region."
 SLAVERYGOOD.1a: "Enrich yourselves, and you shall prosper."
 SLAVERYGOOD.1b: "What luck, we have room for new settlement just over there!"
 SLAVERYGOOD.1c: "Allow the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to help you get started."
 SLAVERYGOOD.2t: "Discontent Among the Naghali of [Root.GetName]"

 SLAVERYGOOD.2a: "No."
 SLAVERYGOOD.2b: "Will allowing you to be governed by one of your own suffice?"
 SLAVERYGOOD.2c: "Fine. Here's some money."
