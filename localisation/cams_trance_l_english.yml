 tranceEvents.t:0 "Trance of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 tranceEvents.d:0 "There often comes the expectation for a leader to participate in trances, or healing dances, throughout the Q'a Numi world. In many communities, rulers are all expected to be able to reach !kia, the enhanced state of consciousness attained by healers in order to capture the n/um, or energy, needed to heal their nation. Over time, Q'a Numi leaders, especially Kx'ai'aas who undergo much greater scrutiny than chiefs, have began to increasingly hire the services of their countries most talented healers, making their rituals too elaborate to fail.\n \nBut alone, being able to successfully complete a ritual for an entire nation, no matter how small, is an incredibly daunting task. Healing rituals are practiced frequently, several times a week in even the smallest Q'a Numi villages. These common rituals, overnight affairs in which healers will dance to exhaustion beyond the sunrise, remedy maladies of the scope of an individual or local community. To be able to capture and understand the n/um of an entire nation would require one to be as talented a ruler as physically possible, and the pressure of undergoing such a ceremony alone under the eyes of the people can permenantly break many lesser rulers."

 TranceTitle.perfect:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Grand Ceremony"
 tranceEvents.1d:0 "At the center of a ceremonial stage in the center of [Root.Capital.GetName], at sunset, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] prepares to beseech the universe for its blessing, to be able to safetly collect the n/um of an entire nation and use this power to heal its woes. The ceremony must be done in the public eye, for the crowd provides a source of energy and can see past falsified Reflections.\n \n [Root.TranceScope]\n \n [Root.TranceResult]"
 TranceScope.national:0 "Assisting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the task, the best healers of the nation have come together with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], forming a circle of the nation's greatest healers, all but guaranteeing the success of their efforts. A massive crowd has already formed around the stage, seeking the enlightenment soon to take place here."
 TranceScope.city:0 "Assisting [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] efforts, the city's best healers and many others closely connected to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have come together to assist [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. A large crowd has formed around the stage, ready to see what these talented individuals can discern from the n/um of the nation."
 TranceScope.commoner:0 "Encouraging the city's elder healers to participate in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] efforts, the city has come alive with activity, the elders bringing with them as many of their kin as are able. These kin would bring their own kin, creating a snowballing effect that made the ceremony into a massive festivity before it even began."
 TranceScope.military:0 "Assisting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] efforts, many of the military's healers have come together in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s service. A large crowd has formed around the stage, ready to see what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those sworn to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] service can discern from the n/um of the nation."
 TranceScope.alone:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is undertaking this effort alone, nearby warriors in the crowd ready at any moment to come to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s defense. A combination of skepticism, confusion, and wonder brings a large crowd to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as they all wonder if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will be divinely blessed, or crack under the pressure of the ceremony."
 TranceResult.perfect:0 "But the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shouts a powerful song, heard to all, dancing with a power and energy before unseen. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] captures the minds and n/um of the crowd, as the n/um lifts [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] up in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] belly and back, shuddering with raw power and sweating profusely. The crowd watches as [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters a powerful state of !kia as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] n/um boils throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire body, and all can feel their n/um being exposed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] perception.\nWhen the sun begins to rise, piercing the black of night in streaks of red and orange, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] collects [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for a reinvigorated round of dancing and singing, at the fastest pace yet, until the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] collapses from exhaustion, marking the end of the ceremony. Over the next few days, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will reflect upon the visions [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had made and share them with the nation."
 TranceResult.greatGroup:0 "The ritual quickly gains tempo as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage begin to collect the n/um around them, creeping up their bodies before dispersing like blood in water, filling every fibre of their being and creating a powerful collective state of !kia. All in the crowd can feel as their n/um is exposed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] perception.\nWhen the sun begins to rise, piercing the black of night in streaks of red and orange, a new round of invigorated dancing and singing begins, at the fastest pace yet, until the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage collapse from exhaustion, marking the end of the ceremony. Over the next few days, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will rigorously discuss and reflect with the other healers upon the discoveries they had made, and share them with the nation."
 TranceResult.decentGroup:0 "The ritual begins to pick up as those on the stage begin to slowly build the n/um around them. Expectedly, the rigorous affair takes hours before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can finally reach a true state of !kia, struggling to discern the individual strains of n/um that all interconnect to make the collective n/um of the nation.\nWhen the sun begins to rise, piercing the black of night in streaks of red and orange, a new round of invigorated dancing and singing begins, at the fastest pace yet, until the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage collapse from exhaustion, marking the end of the ceremony. Over the next few days, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will rigorously discuss and reflect with the other healers upon the discoveries they had made, and share them with the nation."
 TranceResult.mediocreGroup:0 "The ritual takes a long time to build up a decent amount of n/um, the moon long past its height in the night sky before a true state of !kia can be reached. By then, the crowd had already thinned significantly, with especially the youth much too impatient to wait for these visions to be discerned."
 TranceResult.tragicGroup:0 "The festivities only continue to escalate as n/um surges rapidly to the stage, the fires blazing with an untold fury. The n/um energizes the entire crowd - until tragedy strikes. While nobody knows for certain, it seems one of the elders had accidentally pointed a lethal amount of n/um at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], allowing a death thing to leap into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body - for in the midst of the ritual dance and singing, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s voice falters, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] clutches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart and collapses to the stage floor. Chaos ensues, but as the situation unfolds and the healers pronounce the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has passed, a collective mourning begins."
 TranceResult.greatAlone:0 "Yet against all expectations, [Root.Monarch.GetName] quickly gains tempo as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] begins to collect the n/um around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], creeping up their bodies before dispersing like blood in water, filling every fibre of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] being and creating a powerful collective state of !kia. All in the crowd can feel as their n/um is exposed to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s perception."
 TranceResult.decentAlone:0 "Though the critics are proven wrong, as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s slow start to the ceremonial dancing and song begins to pick up, with the crowd feeling the n/um build around them. Expectedly, the rigorous affair takes hours before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can finally reach a true state of !kia, struggling to discern the individual strains of n/um that all interconnect to make the collective n/um of the nation."
 TranceResult.mediocreAlone:0 "For many hours, people continue to wonder as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] struggles to truly captivate themselves and the crowd, though eventually many in the crowd begin to join [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in song, helping [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] ultimately achieve !kia, well past midnight."
 TranceResult.tragicAlone:0 "Unfortunately, they don't have to wonder long. Throughout the ceremony, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] repeatedly fails to capture the attention of the crowd, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] singing is warbled, nervous, and quiet. Instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] begins to quickly tire and crack under the pressure, and the crowd quickly begins to turn. The divine have spoken against the hubris of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the word soon quickly spreads that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is no longer fit to rule."

 tranceEvents.2d:0 "The entire nation has been abuzz, rife with curiosity over what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could have discerned from the nation's n/um from such an elaborate performance at the ceremony. When the time came for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to proclaim the Reflection, the crowd that had gathered nearly doubled the size of the crowd of the ceremony, extending far beyond the city center. It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that the energy of the nation spoke to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in a united melody, speaking of the golden age to come, that this marks the beginning of a whole new era for [Root.Country.GetName]. Soon, fabulous celebrations spread all across the land."
 tranceEvents.2a:0 "Glory to [Root.GetName]!"
 tranceEvents.3da:0 "Curiosity has been growing steadily through the whole of the nation over what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could have learned through their great performance at the ceremony. When the time came for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to proclaim the Reflection, the crowd that gathered was seemingly even larger than the crowd at the ceremony. It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that the greatest threat to the nation is the possibility of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] potential failure. But the spirits provided relief to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], assuring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that the remedy would be in rigorous self-improvement."

It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that if our people don't work hard and take every opportunity to grow and prosper, and provide wealth to the state, than their way of life would eventually be undone by faraway, evil powers. But thankfully, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has the perfect remedy to this malady."

It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that they saw the infrastructure of the nation falling into decay, decrepit housing situations made worse by the downfall of the state, but a remedy in the form of new infrastructure would provide for them a path forward as a nation into a bright future."

It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that the only threat to the nation would be a military loss, and that a great effort must be taken to provide for the nation's warriors all the tools they need to thrive and stay on the cutting edge of warfare against Kaggen's enemies."

 tranceEvents.4da:0 "Some in the capital have grown curious over what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could have possibly discerned from their somewhat lackluster performance at the ceremony. When the time came for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to proclaim the Reflection, the crowd that gathered was barely half the size of the ceremony. It is here that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proclaimed that in their visions, they saw ships leading out to sea, so the only path forward would be to seek the glory of faraway lands."
