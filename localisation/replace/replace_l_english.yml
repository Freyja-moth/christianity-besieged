 jafari_school_desc: "The Jafari Madhab is named after Jaf'ar al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, and it's followers are ‘Twelver' Shias. Twelvers believe that Ali, the successor of Muhammed, was followed by twelve infallible Imams chosen by divine decree. The last of the Imams, al-Mahdi, is expected to return as the savior of mankind, finally enforcing justice and peace in the world. Persecuted in both Arabia and the Hanafiyyah Caliphate, Twelvers were attracted to western Europe, where they have created strongholds of safety in the Salatik and Saulif Emirates."
 hanafi_school: "Faridri"
 hanafi_school_desc: "An Islamic school of jurisprudence that began with the writings of the Andalucian Islamic scholar Faridrih ibn Thayudamus al-Ahmurik al-Dhiki in Thrasanaan the 8th century, hence its namesake, Faridri style law found widespread success in the later stages of the Abbasid Caliphate, its traditions being carried on by the subsequent Haladri Caliphate and later being the stepping stone for the Alsababi reformation. Faridri Islam gives greater power to the Ijma consensus system to settle a greater variety of legal disputes, the key factor to its ease of transformation into Alsababi Islam in al-Andalus and Siqilliya. Otherwise, textual sources in the Quran and Hadiths are given preference, but Faridris have an inclusive view of sources and also employ analogy (Qiya), Istihsan and local customs (Urf) in their jurisprudence."

 maliki_school_desc: "The Maliki Madhab is named after Malik Ibn Anas and is deeply rooted in northwestern Arabia. Jurisprudence is primarily based on the work and interpretations of ibn Anas and his student Sahnun as described in the al-Muwatta and the Mudawwanah. Banned in the Haladri Caliphate because of the influence it provided for Medina, it has concurrently experienced a revival as Medina has found greater influence in the shrinking Sunni world."
 shafii_school_desc: "The Shafi'i Madhab is named after Imam Al-Shafi'i, and while only being found in Africa, as the school of choice, this alone makes it by far the most prominent Sunni jurisprudence. It was once the official doctrine of the Seljuk, Ayyubid and Mamluk Sultanates. Unlike other Madhabs the Shafi'i reject Istihsan Istislah as sources of Sharia, instead only relying on what is textually in the Quran or Hadiths."
 ismaili_school: "Hanafi"
 ismaili_school_desc: "Hanafi is named after Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, the third son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin of Muhammad, the first Imam of the Shi'a Muslims, the fourth Caliph of Sunni Muslims. Unlike the 'Twelvers' and 'Fivers' of the Jafari and Zaidi, the Hanafi believe themselves to be the supreme Aal al-Bayt, and that their rise to power brought about the liberation of the Imams, and their subsequent elevation as Caliphs. A source of contention even within the Hanafi school is whether the Hanafiyyah will produce the Mahdi, or if even the concept of a Mahdi is simply anti-Caliphial conspiracy.\n\n To maintain their perception as the heirs of Muhammad and Abraham, the Caliphate claims ties to Abraham through Princess Elisheva of Judea. Hanafi jurisprudence rapidly grew throughout the pagan and Sunni Shafi'i realm of Sudan, the region around Axum, and the Somali coast, and has continued to rise with the growth of the Ethiopian Caliphate's power. Hanafi encompasses a number of increasingly divergent branches, such as the Musta'li, Nizari, and the now divergent Mudarian sect, which is a consequence of a long history of unrest and a great variation between the philosophies of different Ethiopian Caliphs throughout their history. Given the finite authority of the Caliph, Hanafis often focus on esoteric elements of Shiite faith more than their cousins."

 mcm_hill_raiders_desc: "When faced with a superior enemy, the Gaels of Munster retreat into the hills. They then harry their enemy with a constant series of raids, targeting their supplies, burning down villages and destroying crops, until the enemy is forced to withdraw or starve."
 mcm_spanish_ties: "Iberian Ties"
 mcm_spanish_ties_desc: "The southern Irish have long shared close ties, both economic and political, with the people of Iberia. As the Salatik and Saulfid Emirs grow close over their shared religion, these ties grow stronger. Many young Munster men serve in the Emirate's armies, learning the arts of war."
 mcm_fairer_shores_desc: "The lands of Munster are harsh, with poor soil and unpleasant winters. The chance to make a new life for themselves in the colonies appeals to many. There is never a shortage of volunteers happy to head across the Atlantic."
 mcm_pirate_haven_desc: "Based out of Crookhaven harbour, they prey on shipping from the New World heading to foreign ports. The local authorities are happy to look the other way, as the pirates bring the wealth of the New World to the southern Irish coast."
 mcm_enemies_everywhere_desc: "The enemies of the Saulfids scheme in every corner of the world, even within our own court. We must ensure the patriotism of our subjects through rigorous investigation."

 qar_black_sheep: "The Black Sheep"
 qar_black_sheep_desc: "We are the confederation of the Black Sheep. Our lineage goes back to the great Oghuz Khans and our warriors have made the world tremble. Once we bowed our heads to the Ulug Ulus but we now stand independent and stronger than ever, ready to take on the leadership of all the Turkic clans of the Western Steppe."
 qar_governor_of_azerbaijan: "Governor of the Don"
 qar_governor_of_azerbaijan_desc: "While many of our military campaigns against our Genghisid overlords have given us valuable experience perhaps the most important gain was the title of governor, given to Chief Jahan in order to help him pacify our people. What the Ulug Ulus did not realize is that this allows us to claim the legitimacy of the Empire, who once defeated and conquered all states in the Steppe. This newfound honor gives us a platform to build a lasting hold over the Don, the Pontic Steppe and perhaps even beyond."
 qar_dynamic_warfare: "Dynamic Warfare"
 qar_dynamic_warfare_desc: "Our region has proven perilous for many invaders. The harsh winters of the Steppe require quick adaptation to local circumstances and a keen eye for strategic and tactical advantages. Our prolonged warfare against other Turkoman federations and the Genghisids have allowed us to perfect a dynamic form of warfare, mixing raids, grand maneuver warfare and pitched battles."
 qar_freedom_with_responsibility: "Freedom with Responsibility"
 qar_freedom_with_responsibility_desc: "A truly great ruler is one who knows how to delegate. We have subdued a great number of states over a wide and diverse range of climates and landscapes. If our empire is to grow we must learn to empower local petty dynasties that surrender to our rule, allowing them to tax their own people and raise their own armies in our service."
 qar_patron_of_iranian_culture: "Manichaean Syncretism"
 qar_patron_of_iranian_culture_desc: "As vast quantities of Iranians have travelled vast distances from Central and Eastern Iran, through the Caucasus and Genghisid lands, spreading the word of Mani wherever they go. We should learn from their culture and faith, without losing track of our true Gods."
 qar_irrigation_and_public_works: "Irrigation and Public Works"
 qar_irrigation_and_public_works_desc: "Centuries of warfare, ever since the Mongol invasion, has left the lands of the Western Steppe deveastated. Once bountiful trade that guaranteed the well being of our subjects have been laid to waste and agriculture is held hostage by the whims of the seasons.\nIn the short run we must build up stores of grain so that we can help our people in times of need. In order to secure the future, however, we must restore what was once ruined and rebuild the public works that will allow the Qara Qoyunlu lands to be fertile and productive once more."
 akk_turko_iranian_bureaucracy: "Turko-Iranian Bureaucracy"
 akk_turko_iranian_bureaucracy_desc: "Iran might seem ripe for an army such as ours. It is easy to conquer and keep under foot. However, if we are to extract any form of revenue from our new subjects we will need to rely not only on our military elites. There is no reason that the old administrative families of these lands should not continue to carry out their work. Let us embrace the ancient traditions of Iranian bureaucracy, as long as we make it clear that the military might lies with the armies of the White Sheep."
 akk_apanages: "Dynastic Appanages"
 akk_apanages_desc: "The tribes in our confederation are held together by the loyalty to our great ruler but there are many conflicts within this disparate group of supporters. If we want to avoid splintering over petty tribal conflicts we should strive to keep all conquered land directly within our ruling family, rather than among the chiefs that support us."
 akk_expansive_diplomacy: "Expansive Diplomacy"
 akk_expansive_diplomacy_desc: "Our realm lies at a crossroad between the empires of the Mediterranean and those of Greater Iran. In many ways this region is one of few friends and many enemies. If we are to find allies we will have to look far abroad, perhaps even among the Christian realms of the far west."
 akk_religious_pragmatism: "Religious Pragmatism"
 akk_religious_pragmatism_desc: "These are dangerous times and many look to millenarian sects for answers. We must do what we can to curb religious extremism in our lands, while also working together with the more organized dervish sects that many of the Turkoman warriors belong to. By carefully choosing who to ally and who to fight we can build a stronger state, one that will have the allegiance of the Dervishes without the chaos that religious extremism can bring."
 akk_qanun_nama_ye_hasan: "Qanun-nama-ye Hasan"
 akk_qanun_nama_ye_hasan_desc: "The source of a land’s wealth is its population. The lands under our control have, however, suffered from centuries of warfare. We must protect our urban and rural subjects alike from wanton raids and coercion. Instead we must build and enforce a set of laws to make living and raising wealth in our realm safe and worthwhile. We will grow rich as our subjects prosper."
 reform_the_diwan: "Reform the Diwan"
 reform_the_diwan_desc: "We are fortunate to be served by loyal and well educated Persian administrators that have perfected the art of governance for generations. Sadly, however, a hereditary office is one that over time might stagnate and lack for innovation.\nBy reducing the number of inherited offices with each generation we can make sure that we reward not only loyalty, but also ability. Able administrators must rise to high positions regardless of which family they come from."

The writing of oral traditions began to be traced back to this period, though these texts are not accepted by the Sarmatians or our Karaite bretheren."
