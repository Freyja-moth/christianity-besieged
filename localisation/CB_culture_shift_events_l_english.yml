 cultureshift.1t: "Syrian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.1d: "With the Muslim conquest of Syria, the Aramaic population has adopted Islam, hegemonizing with Arabic traditions. Now, the Aramaic culture has become Syrian."
 cultureshift.1a: "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.2t: "Italyan Culture Develops"
 cultureshift.2d: "When the Lireman Emperor first came to power, he brought with him a substantial migration of Lireman from Illyria, many of whom served in personal retinues. Their distinct cultural identity in Italy was cemented with the Lireman Emperor's conversion to Islam, as the Lireman fervently converted with him before any other Romans on the peninsula. The Alaiturco exonym that they would adopt for themselves is how the Romans perceived them as they proselyzed across the new Roman Caliphate. But that was centuries ago. Since the Caliphate's population has almost entirely adopted Islam, the cultural differences between the Alaiturco and other Roman cultures within the Caliphate have become minimal with many shared linguistic shifts, making communication significantly easier at even the most Vulgar levels. At this point, the Latin speakers of the Caliphate now see themselves as Italyans."
 cultureshift.2a: "A new culture spreads."
 cultureshift.3t: "The Turkig Identity"
 cultureshift.3d: "Many Turkic peoples, especially those of smaller and isolated cultural groups who found themselves surrounded by aggressive foreign powers, were quickly subsumed within the rapidly spreading cultural sphere around the rise of Manichaeism in the region. Manichaean bishops flooded the Balkans, creating militarized religious followings that would serve not only to settle many of the remaining nomadic Turkic peoples but also create a cultural renaissance where many Turkic and Persian but also Anatolian, Caucasian, Hellenic, and Vandalic cultural ideas would synthesize. Many Turks have taken on the identity of Turkig, or the Turks Worthy of Paradise, a title oft given by Iranian bishops to any Turkic converts."
 cultureshift.3a: "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.4t: "Balkanli Culture Develops"
 cultureshift.4d: "Under Rumi dominance, a growing number of Lireman and Qashqai Turks across the Adriatic are beginning to identify as Balkanli, distinguished by fluency in Fus'ha alongside a regional Arabic dialect more heavily influenced by the Arabs than Italyan Arabic, and thusly they hold a greater cultural connection to the Mediterranean world than they ever have before."
 cultureshift.4a: "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.5t: "Juthudi Culture Spreads"
 cultureshift.5d: "As more and more Gothic and Gaulish peoples shed their Germanic identities, learn Fus'ha, and join the theological communities of the Mediterranean, more are identitying as Juthudi."
 cultureshift.5a: "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.6t: "Gothic Culture Returns"
 cultureshift.6d: "As the authority of Wodan's faithful return to the Islamic Goths, old Germanic traditions have been returned, though most of these cultures values and traditions are adapted from those of the ruling Gothic class that has come into control of Juthudi land, as opposed to whatever geographic Germanic dialects were held before their initial Islamic conversion."
 cultureshift.6a: "They'll all return to the fold in time."
 cultureshift.7t: "Emergence of the Andebereans"
 cultureshift.7d: "With the rise of Christianity throughout the Iberian peninsula, a new era has emerged for the diverse peoples who have inhabited the continent. The Arabized-Berber/Roman populations that once were united under Islam have now been more deeply connected to the Celtiberian cultural sphere, but now under the grace of Christ."
 cultureshift.7a: "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.8t: "Spread of Aybirean Culture"
 cultureshift.8d: "Since joining the Islamic cultural sphere in the Mediterranean, the Celtiberian identity that was once held here has been sidelined as the Celtiberians learn Fus'ha and the regional Arabic dialect, finding greater opportunities being connected to the burgeoning Mediterranean world than grasping onto tribal identity."
 cultureshift.8a: "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.9t: "Palestinian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.9d: "With the Muslim conquest of Judea, many Hebrews have adopted Islam and many others have fled to find new homes elsewhere. As many Arabs come to fill the vacant homes left behind, they mingle with the Islamic Hebrews to nurture a new Palestinian culture."
 cultureshift.9a: "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.10t: "Egyptian Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.10d: "Since the end of the second Kingdom of Beta Yis'rael, many Hebrews have adopted Islam and many others have fled to find new homes elsewhere. As many Egyptian Arabs come to fill the vacant homes left behind, they bring the Egyptian identity with them."
 cultureshift.10a: "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.11t: "Jeberti Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.11d: "Since the rise of Islam in the region, and the loss of Jewish autonomy, Hebrews have vacated their homes en masse, with most of the remnants conversion to Islam, leaving the Jeberti culture dominant in the region."
 cultureshift.11a: "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.12t: "Mashriqi Culture Spreading"
 cultureshift.12d: "With the rise of Islam in Mesopotamia, the ancient Assyrian identity is falling to the wayside of the greater Arabic cultural sphere. Learning Arabic for Fush'a and transliterating the Aramaic alphabets in favor of the Arabic script, it's hard to consider these peoples Assyrian anymore."
 cultureshift.12a: "An interesting development."
 cultureshift.13t: "Rise of the Almani"
 cultureshift.13d: "The spread of Islam throughout Germanic land has completely changed their cultures. Once separate tribal identities are now identifying as Almani, an Arabization of the Germanic 'All-Men', united by an understanding of Fus'ha that ties them together and contrasts them to their other Germanic cousins."
 cultureshift.13a: "Fascinating."
 cultureshift.14t: "Balikaac Identity Fading"
 cultureshift.14d: "Since the downfall of Balikoplis, the nobility that once ruled Southeastern Europe has blended itself seamlessly into Cumanac society. Many have become mercenaries, more have started mercantile ventures within and outside the nation, and most of the rest have fallen into place throughout different parts of the nation."
 cultureshift.14a: "As is to be expected."
 cultureshift.15t: "Rise of the Trakyali"
 cultureshift.15d: "Since our jihad and conversion of the region to worship of Allah, the locals have begun to be known as Trakyali. Affluent members are already rising through religious society, speaking perfect Fus'ha in mosques throughout the nation and gaining closer ties to the rest of the affluent Mediterranean."
 cultureshift.15a: "Masha'allah."
 cultureshift.16t: "Rise of the Avandaloi"
 cultureshift.16d: "Since our conversions of Andalucian territory many generations ago, their peoples have been born to love and envy the greatness that is Hellenic culture. The term Andalucian is an old and foreign one- these Hellenic peoples are known as the Avandaloi, and they seek to be a part of our great legacy."
 cultureshift.16a: "Who wouldn't want to be Hellenic?"
 cultureshift.17t: "Rearabization in [Root.GetName]"
 cultureshift.17d: "After centuries of heavy influence from Eranshahr preventing the Arabs of North Arabia from converting to the true faith and reconnecting with their southern bretheren, our liberation seems to have finally brought about the rise of new Islamic Arab culture in the region."
 cultureshift.17a: "How excellent!"
 cultureshift.18t: "Lireman Tradition Spreading"
 cultureshift.18d: "The widespread implementation of Roman traditions in the local Turkish populace has encouraged them to begin to adopt the cultural practices of their Latinized cousins, thusly spreading the Lireman cultural tradition deeper into Illyria."
 cultureshift.18a: "The new cultural fads are fading."
 cultureshift.19t: "Spread of the Kurds"
 cultureshift.19d: "It seems the uniting force of Islam has brought many old communities of [Root.GetName] together with the nearby Kurds. These new peoples show a cultural unity unlike anything seen in the region in a long time."
 cultureshift.19a: "Incredible."
 cultureshift.20t: "Unity of the Iranians"
 cultureshift.20d: "In the wake of the spread of Islam and the Arabization of the region, the prideful Iranian people have seemingly grown together. As the Pahlavi language falls out of favor and is replaced with a text more alike to modern Farsi, the differences between regional dialects thin out, and communication and the spread of information grows between the Iranian communities."
 cultureshift.21t: "Splintering of the Mazowiska"
 cultureshift.21d: "For many centuries, the Lechitic language area of the peoples of Vistula, Polanie, and Masowsze was mutually intelligible, with only minor dialectal differences. However, as the Rodoptr religious rites have brought new linguistic influences, the Lechitic dialect has become distinct enough to become unintelligible to other speakers. The Masowsze have, had this point, become their own distinct culture."
 cultureshift.21a: "They have changed with their understanding of Rod."
 cultureshift.22t: "Rise of a Dalmatli Culture"
 cultureshift.22d: "In 1426, the Lireman Emirate was extinguished by the Unuor Ulus and Sebkhemerz Order. But a successor state arose in Dalmatia, where the Islamic nobility survived and thrived. It is here that a distinct cultural identity quickly came about amongst the upper class while the religious landscape of the old Lireman Emirate changed around them. Having reinforced their identity around the Dalmatli successor state, it is this term that the peoples of the nation have become known by."
 cultureshift.22a: "The true successors of the medieval Lireman."
 cultureshift.23t: "Old Vasconians Descend from the Pyrenees"
 cultureshift.23d: "The Vascones—old inhabitants of northeast Iberia—were last heard about around the rise of the Muslim Iberians, who tried to suppress them in the mid-8th century. After a series of lossy battles, they and their families retreated into the Pyrenees, largely never to be heard from again.....Until now.\nRecently in the province of [Root.GetName], a large group of commoners, emboldened by recent changes in administration, moved into the countryside, bearing the symbols of these fabled people and calling themselves 'Baskoi.'"
 cultureshift.23a: "So the legends *were* true!"
 cultureshift.23b: "From the mountains you came, and hence you must return. We simply cannot have you here."
